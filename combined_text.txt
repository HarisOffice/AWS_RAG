1.1 INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER
A computer is an electronic data processing machine or device that
performs processes, calculations and operations based on instructions
provided by a program. Computers are now used vastly in every field of life.
The advancement in computer caused advancement in knowledge, science
and technology. Today, computers are used in fields of business, industry,
education, banking, transportation, research, explorations, media,
entertainment, etc.
1.1.1 Evolution Of Computers
The computers which we see today are modern shape of computers
which have been evolved since centuries. The evolution of computers is
generally divided in following three eras.
(i) Mechanical Era (Dark Age)
Men have been trying to invent machines that can solve
mathematical problems. In mechanical era, human became successful to
make simple machines that could help performing simple arithmetic
operation, in other words computing. These machines were manually
operated since the electricity was not invented. Some of the important
machines of this era are:
0123456789
(a)
Abacus (3000 B.C.)
Abacus was invented about 5000 years ago. It is
also known as counting frame. Abacus is still used to
teach basic arithmetic operations to the students.
Abacus is considered as first computer prototype.
Fig: 1.1 Abacus

(b) Napier's Bones (1612 A.D.)
Scottish mathematician John Napier
developed Napier's Bones, in 1612.It is also called
Napier's Rods. It was a small machine that contained
ten rods. The rods were made up of bones, wood or
metal. Napier's Bones was used for multiplication
and division.
(c) Slide Rule (1622 A.D.)
English mathematician William
Oughtred invented a Slide Rule. This was
basically a pair of two moveable rules
placed side by side. They had a
standardized set of markings called
scales. These scales were used for
mathematical computations. Slide Rule
was used to multiply and divide numbers.
The modern slide rules are still used in
some countries.

(d) Pascaline or Pascal's Calculator (1642 A.D.)
French mathematician Blaise Pascal
invented a mechanical calculator which was
called Pascaline. He developed this machine
to help his father who was a tax collector.
Pascaline can perform addition and
subtraction by eight figures. User had to
adjust wheels in order to perform these
calculations.
(e)
Leibniz's Calculator (1694 A.D.)
Fig: 1.4 Pascaline
Leibniz's Calculator was developed by
the German mathematician Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz. It was also called stepped
reckoner. It was the first calculator that
could perform all four basic arithmetic
operations; addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
Fig: 1.5 Leibniz Calculator

(f)
Babbage's Difference and Analytical Engines
(1822 and 1837 A.D.)
Charles Babbage was an English mathematician and mechanical
engineer. He is known as Father of Computer because he developed the
first complete computing machine. His first invention was Difference
Engine. It was an automatic mechanical calculator. Difference Engine
was a large machine, made of metal and was powered by steam. The
Difference Engine had storage (mechanical memory) that could hold the
data temporarily for processing and to store results. It was used to allow a
user to enter calculations and get printed results. The Difference Engine
worked on difference equations.
Then, Charles Babbage designed but could not build a very big machine in
1837. This was named Analytical Engine. The proposed design included
an ALU with basic programmatic flow control. It was programmed using
punched cards and contained integrated memory. Historians consider it
to be the first design concept of a general-purpose computer because of its
comprehensive design.
Fig: 1.6 Babbage's Difference Engine
(ii)
Fig: 1.7 Babbage's Analytical Engine
Electro-Mechanical Era (Middle Age)
This era starts from the mid of 19th century. In this era scientists
became able to develop faster and more accurate computing machines as
they were powered by steam and electricity. One of such machines was
Tabulating Machine.

5
сл
(a) Herman Hollerith's Tabulating Machine (1890 A.D.)
It was invented by American inventor
Herman Hollerith in 1890. Hollerith's first
tabulator was used for the U.S. 1890
Census. Because of Hollerith's tabulating
machine census data took only six months to
compile, which was very fast as compared to
previous U.S. census in 1880 which took 7
years to be completed. Hollerith Tabulating
Machine became very famous and used in
many offices of U.S. Government.
(iii) Electronic Era (Modern Age)
Fig: 1.8 Tabulating Machine
The advancement in the vacuum or electron tube gave birth to the
electronic era. In this era the true computers were invented which worked
on the principle of input, store, process and output. Continuous
advancement in electronic engineering increased efficiency and speed of
computers considerably. The electronic era may be categorized in
generations on the basis of core technology used to build computers.
(a) First Generation of Computers (1940 to 1956)
Based on vacuum tubes, first
generation computers were very
large in size. This generation
computers used machine language
(i.e. 1's and O's). Magnetic drums
were used as primary internal
storage medium and punched cards
for input. In this generation mainly
batch processing operating system
was used. Computers of this
generation were primarily used for
scientific and research purposes.
Electronic Numerical Integrator and
Calculator (ENIAC), Universal
Automatic Computer (UNIVAC) are
examples of first generation
computers.
Fig: 1.9 Vacuum Tubes

10
(b) Second Generation of Computers (1956 to 1963)
Because of transistors computers
became smaller, faster, cheaper and more
efficient. Assembly language and a high-level
language FORTRAN were introduced. Magnetic
core was used as primary internal storage
medium. Punched Cards were used for input.
Batch processing and Multiprogramming
Operating systems were used. These computers
were mainly used for commercial productions,
scientific and engineering analysis and design.
Examples are IBM 7094 and IBM 1401.
Fig: 1.10 Transistors
(c) Third Generation of Computers (1964 to 1971)
Use of ICs further decreased size
of computers and increased the speed
and efficiency. Less expensive
computers were introduced. High level
programming languages such as Pascal
and COBOL were used. Keyboard as
input and monitor as output also eased
the use of computer. Time-sharing and
Realtime Operating Systems were used.
D-UP
The use of computers was extended to Fig: 1.11 Integrated Circuits (ICs)
database management and automatic industrial control. IBM 360 and
IBM 370 are the examples of this generation's computers.
(d) Fourth Generation of Computers (1971 to Present)
The invention of microprocessors was
revolutionary which caused the development of
faster, less expensive, smaller and more
reliable computers. They used semi-conductor
memories RAM and ROM and magnetic storage
became popular. More high-level languages
were introduced like C, C++, Java, etc. These
computers are used in almost every field of life,
like space applications, business and art work.
Fig: 1.12 Microprocessors

Time sharing, real time and distributed operating system are used. This
generation also saw the development of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).
Examples are Apple Macintosh, IBM PC.
(e) Fifth Generation of Computers (Present and Beyond)
Fifth Generation computing
devices are still being developed.
In this generation computers will
be capable of self- learning,
reasoning and generalization.
These computers or controlled
machines like robot will also be
able to process human languages.
The branches of AI include;
Machine Learning, Deep Learning.
Natural Language Processing,
Robotics and Expert Systems.

According to Technology
According to technology or type of data they handle, computers are
classified into three types.
(a) Analog Computers
Analog Computers are used to process
analog data. Analog data are in the form of
continuously varying physical quantities like
pressure, temperature, voltage, speed and weight.
Examples of Analog computer are speedometer of
a car, voltmeter etc.
(b) Digital Computers
Digital Computers are most commonly
used type of computers. They are used to
process information with quantities using the
binary number system (O's and 1's). Digital
Computers are used in home, educational
institutes, offices, business, scientific fields, etc.
(c) Hybrid Computers
Hybrid Computers are the combination of
Analog and Digital Computer system. These
computers combine analog and digital features
of computers in a single machine. A Hybrid

Computers are also divided into four groups according to their size.
Super Computers
Super Computers are the most powerful, fastest and largest
computers. They are extremely expensive. These computers are widely

used in scientific applications such as aerodynamics, design simulations,
processing of geological data, weather forecasting and nuclear research.
(b)
Mainframe
Mainframe Computers are powerful multi-user and multi-
processors computers. They can process huge amount of calculations at
very high speed. Mainframes are also very expensive and require a lot of
technical expertise to be installed and operated. They are used in banks
and many large business organizations where several users work
simultaneously.
(c)
Minicomputer
These are smaller than mainframe computers, but they are more
powerful than Microcomputers. Minicomputers usually use multi-user
operating system. Multiple users can use the Minicomputers through
terminals. Minicomputers may be used as network servers and Internet
servers. DEC VAX and IBM AS/400 are good examples of minicomputers.
(d)
Microcomputers
Microcomputers are also called Personal Computers (PCs). The use
of microprocessor has made computers cheaper yet faster and more
reliable. These are the smallest computers designed to be used by
individuals. PCs can be used for variety of tasks like documentation,
calculations, illustration and entertainment. The power of network and
internet has also made it more useful. Now computers are also used for
communication and socialization.
(iii) According to Purpose
According to purpose, computers are either general purpose or
special purpose.
(a) General Purpose Computers
Most computers in use today are General Purpose Computers.
These computers can process variety of tasks. These computers can store
and execute different programs in their memory. Therefore, various tasks
like word processing (typing & editing), payrolls, accounts, inventory

10
control, manipulating facts in a database, making
scientific calculations and statistical data
analysis, and controlling security system of an
organizations are achieved by these computers.
Desktops, laptops, tablets and smart phones are
examples of General Purpose Computers.
(b) Special Purpose Computers
As the name states, Special Purpose
Computers are designed to perform specific
tasks. Special Purpose Computers repeatedly
perform single job more efficiently. They are also
known as Dedicated Computers. These
computers are useful in traffic lights control
system, navigational system, aviation, weather
forecasting, satellite tracking and ATMs.

1.2 ROLE OF COMPUTER
The role of computer in our lives is increasing day by day. In this
section, we will discuss different aspects of the changing role of computer.
1.2.1 Computers In Different Fields Of Life
We are living today in the information era and the information has
become one of the most valuable assets. To process this information, we
make use of computers in various fields in our daily life. Computers have
been integrated in our life in different shapes and sizes like desktops,
laptops, mobile phones, gaming consoles and smart devices. Our lives
have become so dependent of computers that we cannot work even a
single day without the help of it. We have automated many of the repetitive
tasks with the help of more advanced, faster and accurate computers and

11
brought our routine tasks, office
works, businesses, researches
and industrial applications to a
new level.
Computers are largely
used in every field of life.
Manufacturing, ecommerce,
education, medical, banking,
communication, entertainment,
engineering, agriculture,
architecture, business, defense,
and sports are highly influenced
by computers.
Computers Today and Tomorrow
Fig: 1.19 Radiology computer
21st century is the era of technological revolution. Previously,
technology was only used to access and share information. However, with
the passage of time, the rapid change in technology has made it nearly
impossible to perform any human activity without its use.
Computers are playing an important part in our daily life. News,
weather updates, travelling information and bookings, money transfer
and even taxi bookings are done with the help of mobile phone apps. Many
managerial tasks are also done by computer software. School, library and
hospital management are some examples. Online shopping is becoming a
trend in our society too.
Computers are also providing variety of choices for entertainment
like online games in which players from different parts of the world can
participate simultaneously. 3D graphical software has given a new look to
movies in which different comic characters can act with human actors.
Photo, sound and video editor software not only help artists and singers to
produce extraordinary creations but also inexperienced people can enjoy
their productivity with ease of use.
The emerging technologies are also getting better day by day and we
can imagine that how computer will be used in future. Artificial
Intelligence, Robotics, Wireless Communication and Virtual Realities are
some areas which are shaping the modern world.

12
Artificial Intelligence is based on simulating human intelligence in
machines that can easily mimic and execute tasks from simple to more
complex operations. The term A.I. may also be referred to any machine
that displays qualities associated with a human brain such as learning,
reasoning and problem solving. A.I. is also used for Machine Learning. It
learns from our daily routines and suggests us different options. Like
google maps suggest the best ways for our daily commute. A.I. is vastly
used in scientific experiment, healthcare and space technologies.
Robots are the machines that can be controlled by a computer and are
capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. Robots
can be controlled by an external control device or through programming.
Robotics deals with designing, creating and programming of the robot and
enhancing it by taking sensory feedback and processing information.
Robots are commonly used in manufacturing, industry, science, medicine
and education.
Wireless Communication has become an integral part of our lives.
Wireless communication technology transmits information using
electromagnetic waves like IR (Infrared), RF (Radio Frequency), satellite, etc.
Global Positioning System (GPS) is now used to find real time location of
people and objects. Smart phones that include 3G, 4G and 5G networks have
transformed the conventional use of telephones. These phones not only
provide better coverage but also fast mobile internet experience. Wireless
communication is also giving new meaning to the socialization and human
interactivity.
Virtual Reality is an artificial environment that is created with software
and presented to the user in a way that the user feels it as a real
environment. Virtual reality can be used for the simulation of a real
environment for training and education. It is also used for development of
an imagined environment for a game or interactive story.
Teacher
Note
It is very important to orient students about the
contemporary and upcoming technologies. Teachers may
show videos on smartphone or projectors for better
understanding of students, in this regard.

1.3 COMPUTER HARDWARE
Computers consist of software and hardware. Software is the
programs and applications that run on computer. Hardware is the
physical parts of the computer that run programs and applications.
Hardware can be seen and touched while software cannot.
Computer hardware is a collection of all the physical parts or components
of a computer. It includes the computer casing, the CPU or Central
Processing Unit, computer memory, VGA graphics card, sound card, and
the motherboard.

15
1.3.1 System Unit
A System Unit is the part of a computer that contains the primary
devices. The system unit performs operations and produces results for
complex calculations. It includes the motherboard, CPU, RAM and other
components, as well as the case in which these devices are enclosed.
(i)
Motherboard
The motherboard is the main board which connects different parts
of computer. It includes the following general components:
Microprocessor (CPU), Slots, Ports, Buses, RAM, ROM and other
electronic components for example resistors, capacitors, diodes,
transistors, jumpers etc.
Fig: 1.20 Motherboard
Just like nervous system it allows communication between all parts of
the computer. We can find CPU, memory slots, expansion slots and a
number of chipsets on motherboard. Motherboards are made of layered
fiberglass. These layers contain copper lines that form the circuitry by which
electrical signals are provided to all parts of computer. Various components
of computer may be attached, detached and upgraded on motherboard
according to need of the user. Motherboards also have connectors called
ports. These ports are used to connect input, output and other peripheral
devices.
Teacher
Note
Uncover the casing of computer and demonstrate different
parts on and attached with motherboard. Ask students to
write names and functions of the components.

16
(ii)
Microprocessor (CPU)
(intel inside
CORE I5
CPU or microprocessor is
the brain of computer. The
microprocessor is a chip
containing millions of tiny
transistors. These transistors
manipulate data. Microprocessor
performs all the calculations
necessary to make the computer
work. These calculations are
performed at very high speed and
accuracy. Microprocessor is made
up of silicon. The microprocessor
fetches, decodes, executes and
stores all the instructions given by
the user or any other device. The speed of computer mainly depends upon
the speed of microprocessor. A microprocessor that has faster clock speed
(measured in GHz) and more cores and cache works faster.
(intel
Fig: 1.21 Microprocessor
There are typically five components of a microprocessor.
(a)
Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
ALU performs all the actual calculations like arithmetic operations
and logical comparisons. Arithmetic operations include addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division while logical comparisons
include comparing, selecting and matching of data.
(b) Control Unit (CU)
Control Unit is responsible for controlling the transfer of data and
instructions among other units of a computer. This unit controls the
operations of all parts of the computer but does not carry out any actual
data processing operations. CU functions just like a traffic policeman. It
manages and coordinates all the units of the computer.
(c) Clock
Clock generates pulses and instructions are executed on the basis
of pulses. Clock speed is measure in MHz and GHz.

17
(d)
Registers
It is a temporary storage area that holds the data that is being
processed. It is also known as programming model which may be of 8 bits,
16 bits, 32 bits or 64 bits.
(e)
Cache
Cache is an intermediate storage area, which is available inside
microprocessor. The immediate processed information is stored in cache.
The cache inside the microprocessor is called internal cache and outside
is called external cache.
(iii) Buses
In computer, Buses are the electric paths on which data is sent and
received by different components. They are just like roads. As roads
connect different places, buses connect all the parts of the computer to
each other. They also connect all internal components on the
motherboard.
There are three types of buses; control bus, data bus and address bus.
Control Bus carries command between different components to control
all activities in a computer.
Data Bus carries data between the processor, memory unit and other
components.
Address Bus carries the address of the data (but not the data).The
address bus is used to specify memory location to be used by
microprocess for specific operaation.
1.3.2 Input Devices
Input devices are used to enter data into computers. These devices
can be categorized into Text Entering, Pointing and Image Scanning
Devices.
(i) Text Entering Devices
Keyboard: It is the most common text entering device and used to enter
data usually in text format or to perform other controlling functions.

18
When a key is pressed, keyboard controller chip sends its corresponding
code in keyboard buffer called scan code, which is then processed by CPU.
(ii)
Pointing Devices (Mouse and its variants)
They are used for the quick movement of cursor on screen needed
usually in graphic mode. It includes mouse, joy stick, track ball and
track pad.
(iii) Image Scanners
Scanners convert image into electronic format understandable by
computers through light sensing. They also work on Optical Recognition
which occurs when a device scans a clear printed surface and translates
the image into machine-readable formats that a computer understands.
Image scanners include Optical Mark Recognition (OMR), Optical Barcode
Reader (OBR) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
(iv) Other Types of Input devices
There are also other input devices. For example, microphones are
used to accept sound input and convert it in digital audio format.
Microphones are also used for voice recognition which can convert voice
input into text files. Touch Screen is also used for input. It accepts input
directly on monitor by touching finger or any object on the screen.
Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) and Magnetic Strip Reader
are also used for input.
1.3.3 Output Devices
A hardware device that sends data from a computer (CPU) to
another device or user is called an output device. The most common
output devices of a computer are monitor and printer. There are two types
of output devices.
(i)
Soft Copy Output Devices
It is screen display or voice output. It is volatile output and lost
when other output is shown or computer is turned off. Following are some
of the devices used to give output in soft form.

19
(a)
Monitors
It is TV like device that displays data by small bright dots called
pixels. Monitors are of two types.
.
•
Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)
Flat Panel Display (FDP)
(b) Data Projectors
Data projectors are used to show colorful slides and images directly
from computer disk on a wall or large screen through an optical lens. They
are also called digital light projectors and video projectors.
(c)
Speakers
Speakers give output in form of sound. They are good for people
with visual disabilities or where display is not easy.
(ii) Hard Copy Output Devices
It is output on paper. It is nonvolatile output that is relatively stable
and permanent form. Hard Copy Output Devices are:
(a) Printers
They usually give output on paper and can print both text and
graphics. There are two types of printers:
•
Impact
Non-Impact
(b) Plotters
Like printer it gives images on paper but typically used to print large
format images such as maps, construction drawing, advertising
hoardings etc.
1.3.4 Storage Devices
A storage device refers to a hardware used to store information.
There are two types of storage devices; Primary and Secondary.

20
(i)
Primary Storage Devices
Primary storage devices are used by computer during processing.
They are quite smaller in storage capacity. Most primary storage devices
are found inside the computer, and they have the fastest access to data.
Primary devices include RAM and ROM.
ROM is the Read Only Memory. It is permanent memory. ROM is quite
small in capacity. It stores the major setting of computer permanently.
RAM is Random Access Memory. RAM is volatile, means it loses its
content as the power supply is disconnected. This is used to store data
and instructions temporarily.
(ii) Secondary Storage Devices
Secondary storage devices have a larger storage capacity and can
store data permanently. Users save their data on secondary storage
devices. Hard Disk, CD and DVD, SD Card and USB flash disk are the
examples of secondary storage devices.

1.4 BASIC OPERATIONS OF A COMPUTER
A computer is a machine that acts according to the instructions
given by the user. A computer performs four basic operations: input,
processing, output and storage.
(i)
Input
Computer input has many forms. It can be from a command
entered using a keyboard or a mouse. It can be data sent from another
computer on a network.
(ii)
Processing
Processing is done inside the computer by CPU. Processing is the
conversion of input into output. After processing, data is turned into
meaningful information. This is carried out with the help of arithmetic and
logical operations.

21
(iii) Storage
Storage refers to the holding or saving data. RAM, ROM and Hard
Disk are the devices that are used for storage.
(iv) Output
Output is the result of a computer processing. Output may be
viewed on a monitor screen, heard through speakers or printed on paper.
Here, monitor screen, speakers and printer are called output devices.

1.5 COMPUTER SOFTWARE
Software is a set of instructions that a computer uses to perform a
task. It is a general term for a computer program. There are two main
types of software; System Software and Application Software.
1.5.1 System Software
System software is a computer program that coordinates all
activities and functions of a computer. It also controls all the operations of
the computer hardware. It includes operating systems, device drivers,
utility programs and language translators.
(i) Operating System
Operating system is the master control program that manages all
the system resources. It creates an interface between computer system
and user. Windows and Linux are commonly used operating systems.
(ii) Device Drivers
Device drivers are computer programs that control a particular
device when it is connected to a computer. Any hardware that we have in
our computer must have a device driver to communicate with operating

22
22
system. A device driver is a translator between the operating system and
the hardware device. For many devices, operating system has drivers pre-
installed in them. This gave rise to the concept of Plug and Play, where the
device would be attached to the computer and the operating system will
instantly recognize it. A non-plug-and-play device would require you to go
through several steps of installing drivers and setting up the device before
it would work.
(iii) Utility Programs
Utility means being useful. Utility programs are useful computer
programs that help to manage, maintain and control computer resources.
Operating systems usually have pre-installed programs that can serve the
purpose, but utility software provides further functionality. One example
of utility program is an antivirus software. This computer program helps
to protect a computer from viruses and other harmful files.
Hard Disk tools are also part of utility programs. They manage hard
disk drives and other storage devices. This includes utilities to scan the
hard disks for any potential problems. Disk cleaner utility is used to
remove any unnecessary files while disk defragmenter is used to re-
organize file on a hard disk drive to increase performance of disk.
(iv) Language Translators
Language Translators are used to translate human readable
instructions into machine language. Computer can only understand
machine language which is composed of O's and 1's. The computer
languages are used to make computer programs (software). Generally,
software is written in high-level languages, using natural language words.
Language translator are of three types; assembler, compiler and
interpreter.
Teacher
Note
Teachers are suggested to demonstrate how to configure/
install device drivers and use utility programs like Disk
Defragmenter, Disk Cleaner etc.

23
(a)
(b)
(c)
Assembler: The assembler translates the program written in
assembly language into machine language instructions for
execution.
Compiler: It translates the entire high-level language program at
once into machine language before it is executed.
Interpreter: It translates the high-level language program line by
line into machine language.
1.5.2 Application Software
Application Software is used to complete specific tasks, such as
creating documents, databases, spreadsheets and presentations.
Computer games, media players and web browsers are also the examples
of application software. User needs to install application software to
accomplish specific tasks. Application software are not pre-installed on
operating system. They are installed separately. For example, making
spreadsheet is not possible with Windows. For that application software
such as MS Excel is used. There are different types of application software.
Productivity Software
(i)
This kind of application software is used to produce things such as
documents, spreadsheets, databases and presentations. Many of the
productivity software are intended to be used in businesses and offices.
MS Office for Windows is an example of productivity software.
(ii)
Business Software
Business Software are used to manage business activities
efficiently. It is used to provide many business functions such as billing,
database management and inventory management.
(iii)
Entertainment Software
This type of software provides amusement and fulfills a user's
hobby. The most common entertainment software are video games.
(iv)
Educational Software
Educational software is used for teaching and learning. This kind of
software is used in many schools to enhance knowledge of students in
learning different subjects.

2.1 INTRODUCTION OF OPERATING SYSTEM (OS)
An Operating System is a software which performs all the basic
tasks like booting the computer, file management, memory management,
process management, and controlling peripheral devices such as hard
disk, printer, etc. It manages computer resources efficiently. Most
common operating systems are: DOS, Windows, Linux, Android, Mac OS
and iOS.

Fig: 2.1 Different Operating Systems
2.1.1 Function Of Operating System
Operating system manages every activity of a computer. It is the
master control program that provides an interface for a user to
communicate with computer. System software and application software
run on operating system as shown in figure 2.2. Operating System
performs the following functions.

(i) Booting
Booting is a process of
starting the computer operating
system. It checks the computer
resources and makes it ready to
perform different tasks.
(ii) Resource Management
Operating system manages
all the hardware and software
resources. This includes allocation
and de-allocation of processor,
memory, access to shared cache
memory and access to network
resources.

(iii) User Interface or Command Interpreter
We interact with operating system through user interface.
Command interpreter is one of the parts of operating system which reads
the commands from user, interprets them and translates them into
machine language instructions that the computer hardware can
understand.
(iv) Memory Management
Memory management module performs the task of allocation and
de-allocation of memory space to programs and data in need of these
resources.
(v)
Input/Output (I/O) Management
An Operating System provides the device driver to facilitate I/O
functions involving I/O devices. These device drivers are software that
control I/O devices through their controllers.

33
(vi) File Management
It manages all the file-related activities such as organization
storage, retrieval, naming, sharing, and protection of files.
(vii) Process Management
A process is a job or activity to be performed by the system. Process
management manages creation, deletion, suspension and resumption of
processes. The term process refers here to program code that has been
loaded into a computer's memory for execution by the central processing
unit (CPU). In a multiprogramming system, there will be a number of
computing processes. The operating system must ensure that each
process gets a fair share of the CPU's time. The OS decides the order in
which processes have access to the processor, and how much processing
time each process should get. This function of OS is called process
scheduling.

(viii) User Management
In modern operating systems, user management describes the
ability of administrators to control user access to various computer
resources like software, I/O devices, storage system, networks, etc.
2.1.2 Types Of Interface
An interface is a program that allows a user to interact with the
computer or another computer over a network.
A User Interface (UI) is the part of operating system, program, or devices
that allows a user to enter and receive information. There are many types
of User Interfaces. Two most common user interfaces are discussed below:
(i)
Command Line Interface
C:\DOS chkdsk
Volume Serial Number is 3E76-4B58
2,146,467,848 bytes total disk space
131,872 bytes in 2 hidden files
32,768 bytes in 1 directories
7,485,568 bytes in 124 user files
2,138,898, 432 bytes available on disk
32,768 bytes in each allocation unit
65,585 total allocation units on disk
65,274 available allocation units on disk
655, 360 total bytes мемory
602,704 bytes free
Instead of using CHKDSK, try using SCANDISK.
and fix a much wider range of disk problems.
type HELP SCANDISK from the command prompt.

For more information,
C:\DOS>
Fig: 2.4 Command Line Interface (CLI)
A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a screen or text based
representation in which the user types the commands on place called
prompt to operate the computer. Command contains string of
characters. CLI is difficult to use because the user has to remember the
commands and their syntaxes but it is fast in use because text mode takes
less resources. It was primarily provided to users by computer terminals
on UNIX, and personal computers including MS-DOS and Apple DOS.

35
(ii)
Graphical User Interface (GUI)
A GUI provides a user friendly environment where user can interact
with computers through graphical objects such as menus, icons, buttons
and other graphical objects. It is easy to use as users are supposed to just
click on a picture to run commands without memorizing them. GUI is
slower than CLI as graphical mode takes more memory and resources.
Windows and IOS are the example of GUI.

2.2 TYPES OF OPERATING SYSTEM
The Operating System can be categorized as under:
.
Single User and Multi-User OS
• Batch Processing OS
• Time Sharing OS
Real Time Processing OS

36
2.2.1 Single User And Multi-user Operating System
In a Single User Operating System, a single user can access the
computer system at a time. These types of operating systems are
commonly used. DOS for PCs and Windows 98 for PCs are example of
single user operating system.
A Multi-User Operating System allows multiple users to access the
computer at same time. The operating system manages the memory and
resources among the various users according to the requirement. Linux
and UNIX are the most common examples of the multi-user operating
system.
2.2.2 Batch Processing Operating System
General term of Batch Processing is used for programs that are
executed with minimum human interaction. This type of operating system
does not interact with the computer directly (Figure 2.5). Each user
prepares his job and submits it to the computer operator. To speed up
processing; jobs with similar needs are batched together and run as a
group by an operator. The main function of a batch processing system is to
automatically keep executing the jobs in a batch.
The benefits of batch processing are:
•
Batch systems can be shared by multiple users.
• The idle time for batch system is very less.
.
Next job starts just after the current one.

2.2.3 Time Sharing Operating System
Time sharing is a method that allows multiple users to share
resources simultaneously. Multiple users can use specific computer at
the same time in different places. A time sharing operating system is that
in which from many tasks each task is given some time to execute so that
all processes run smoothly without any problem. Multiple jobs are
executed by the CPU by switching between them. As the system switches
rapidly from one task or user to the other, a short time slot is given to each
task or user for their executions and all feel that system is not shared.
Thus, the user can receive an immediate response. For example, in a
transaction processing, the processor executes each user program in a
short time.These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems. The
task can be from single user or from different users also. The time that
each task gets to execute is called quantum. After this time interval is over
OS switches over to next task.

2.2.4 Real Time Processing Operating System (RT OS)
A Real Time Processing Operating System is a time bound operating
system which has fixed time limit. Processing has to be done within the
defined time limit otherwise system will be failed. Real Time Process
System classified into two parts:

38
Hard Real Time System: A Hard Real Time System guarantees that
critical tasks complete on time, even the shortest delay or urgency is not
acceptable. Here system should meet the deadline. Missile systems and
Air Traffic Control System are best examples of Hard Real Time System.
Soft Real Time System: In this time constraint is less strict. The meeting
of deadline is not compulsory for each task, every time. A critical real-time
task gets priority over other tasks until it completes. It does not guarantee
that task will be completed in defined time but before a certain time and
according to the priority. Online Transaction System, Airline Ticket
Reservation in which reservation could be delayed but should be done
after checking available seats and completed before aeroplane flight, etc.
are the examples of Soft Real Time System.

2.3 SOFTWARE INSTALLATION
Software installation is the process of making programs ready for
execution. Software installation or installer is a computer program that
installs files, such as applications, drivers, or other software, onto a
computer. Software is installed onto a computer by various means. They
can be downloaded from the internet. They can also be installed from an
installation CD or DVD or from a USB flash drive.
2.3.1 Installing Windows Operating System
Operating system is the most essential software and there are many
operating systems available. Windows is the most commonly used
operating system which is developed by Microsoft. Choosing an operating
system depends upon the hardware that we have. To maintain
compatibility between hardware and software, the operating system
vendor specifies the minimum hardware requirement. For installing
Windows 10, we will need at least the following configuration.

2.3.2 Installing Office Automation Software
Windows is an Operating System which needs to install other
software to make the best use of our computer. Office Automation
software is the most common software package that we install on our
computers. Office Automation software is a group of computer programs
that help users in their daily work. Generally you will find MS Office in
school lab, offices and other places. MS Office contains word processor
(MS Word), spreadsheet (MS Excel), multimedia presentation (MS
PowerPoint), database management system (MS Access) and email
application (MS Outlook). In class 9, we will use MS- Word, MS Excel and
MS-Access in coming units.

Before installing MS- Office, make sure that your hardware and
software meet with the minimum requirements for the version of MS-
Office that you want to install. The minimum requirements may differ
from version to version. (For MS- Office 2013 the minimum requirements
are: 1.6 GHz processor, 1 GB RAM, 3 GB hard disk free space, minimum
Windows 7 operating system and graphics driver).
2.3.3 Installing Antivirus
To keep our computer secure and free from viruses, we need to
install an antivirus software. A number of free antivirus software are
available online. AVG, Avast, Avira and Kaspersky are some of the free
antivirus software. These days we need to download installation file from
respective antivirus software and run it but make sure that computer has
the access of internet. After running the installation file, antivirus
software will be automatically installed on our computer.
Most important component of an antivirus software is the virus
database which antivirus software updates time to time. We must update
our virus database for preventing virus threats.
Teacher
Note
i
There are 5 lab periods allocated to complete the
SLOS of this unit. However, teachers can manage
more practical for students and help enhancing their
skills to use operating system efficiently. Students at
this level should be able to manage files and folders
and configure simple settings of operating system.
Teachers are also suggested to demonstrate the
installation and configuration process of any
hardware driver e.g. printer.

A single user operating system allows only one user to operate
computer at a time.
A Multi-User Operating System allows multiple users to access the
computer at same time.
In fact the real time operating system consists of Windows, Linux, etc.
In batch processing operating system each user prepares his job and
submits it to the computer operator.
Time sharing is a method that allows multiple users to share resources
simultaneously.
A Real Time Processing operating system is a time bound operating
system which has fixed time limit.
A Hard Real Time System guarantees that critical tasks complete on
time. Missile systems and Air Traffic Control System are best examples
of Hard Real Time System.
Soft Real Time System does not guarantee that task will be completed
in defined time. Online Transaction systems, Airline Ticket
Reservation, etc. are the examples of Soft Real Time System.
Software Installation means to put something in a new place, ready to
be used.

Microsoft Word (MS Word) is one of the
most famous word-processing software. It
was first released and made public in early
1980s by Microsoft. It allows its user to type
text and manipulate it. MS Word first
introduced the concept of WYSIWYG (What
You See Is What You Get) by introducing text
formatting and document preview exactly as
we would get it on a paper. It has advanced
features like tables, images, advanced
formatting and reviewing that give its users
the ability to customize their documents as
required. Even most of this book has been
written, edited and formatted on MS Word. Latest versions of MS Word
come as a part of Microsoft Office Suite (which includes other software as
well like MS Excel and MS PowerPoint). MS Word is still most widely used
word-processing software in the world. We will be using MS Word 2010
version in this chapter.
3.1.1 Page Layout Tab
Figure 3.1
MS Word 2010
The Page Layout Tab allows user to control the look and feel of his
or her document. User can set margins, apply themes, control page
orientation and size, add sections and line breaks, display line numbers,
and set paragraph indentation and lines. The Page Layout tab has five
groups of related commands namely Themes, Page Setup, Page
Background, Paragraph and Arrange.

3.1.3 Typing in Urdu and Sindhi Languages
MS Word 2010 helps in writing letters, applications, CVs, question
papers and books in default language set by Microsoft Windows (that is
usually English). MS Word 2010 also supports typing text in various other
languages like Urdu and Sindhi. To be able to write in other languages, the
keyboards for those languages have to be installed in Microsoft Windows.
MS Word also supports changing and setting its default language. To
change the default language, go to the File menu and select Options. From
the Word Options dialog box, select Language tab. Now choose one of the
available languages as the default language for MS Word 2010.
Teacher
Note
Teachers are required to demonstrate the installation of
multiple languages like Urdu and Sindhi in Microsoft
Windows. They can do so by adding languages from the
Regional Settings of Windows Control Panel. Installation
of these languages also installs their keyboard layouts
and enables the ability to type text in those languages.

3.2.2 Sorting
Sorting is the process of rearranging or reordering data based on
different criteria like size, quality, value and quantity. MS Excel has the
ability to sort data according to the needs of the user. To help better
understand this concept, take or create a list of products with their unit
prices and quantities as shown below.
The objective is to
sort this list of products
with prices and quantities,
in alphabetical order based
on the names of the
products. To achieve this,
first select all the rows and
columns which make up
this product list then go to
the Data tab and select the
Sort option.
In the Sort dialog
box, choose Product from
the Sort by dropdown list
and make sure that in the

as shown in the figure here. This data can also be sorted in terms of unit
price and quantity.
3.2.3 Formulas
MS Excel 2010 allows its user to perform numerous calculations on
data. Common calculations include addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division. Comparison of two numbers and finding their average is also

56
possible. Formulas tell MS Excel what calculation needs to be performed
on the data. Formulas always start with an equal sign (=). They are defined
in the Formula Bar.
To understand this concept, take an example of two numbers,
which are 220 and 87, placed in columns A2 and B2, respectively. The
objective is to add these two numbers using MS Excel formula. To achieve
this, follow these steps:
1. Select cell C2.
2. Type=(equal sign).
3. Select cell A2 in the worksheet by
using the mouse or the keyboard.
This action places the cell
reference A2 in the formula of
selected cell.
4. Type +.
5. Select cell B2 in the worksheet by
using the mouse or the keyboard
to put that cell's reference in the
formula of selected cell.
6. Press Enter.

7. The answer (307) will be calculated by MS Excel and displayed in
the selected cell (C2) where the addition formula was composed.
Likewise subtraction, multiplication, division and other
mathematical functions can be applied.
3.2.4 Charts
Charts are also known as graphs. They include diagrams and
tables. Charts feature in MS Excel allows the users to present a set of data
visually. A huge set of data may not succeed in presenting its meaning to
the reader whereas visual information helps better understand those data
values at a glance. To understand this concept, take an example of the
average monthly temperature for Larkana in 2018 as shown below:

43°C 11 November 31°C
44°C 12 December 24°C

57
The temperature table contains data in a form which is not very
helpful for every user to understand. If the same data is converted into a
graph or chart, the user would be better able to reach a conclusion. From
the bar chart, we can easily derive the hottest and the coldest months and
compare them with each other.
The same data, if displayed as a graph or chart, will give more
meaning and a user can easily derive an understanding of such values at a
glance as seen in the below figures.

4.1 BASICS OF DATA COMMUNICATION
Communication is the process of sharing a message. A
conversation between two people is an example of communication. Data
communications refers to the sharing of a virtual message. Electronic
communications, like emails and instant messages and phone calls are
examples of data communications. Data communication is the exchange
of digital messages between two devices. It involves a sender and a receiver
which communicate via some form of transmission medium such as a
cable.
4.1.1 Basic Terminologies of Data Communication
In order to understand the data communication, it is good to know
some basic terms related to it.
(i) Data
Collection of raw facts and figures is called data. The word data is
derived from Latin language and it is plural of Datum. The text, numbers,
symbols, images, voice and video which are processed by computers and
digital devices are called data. Data can be considered as unprocessed
information.
(ii)
Data Communication
Data Communication is the process of transferring data
electrically from one place to another. It is the process of exchange of data
and information between two parties such as human and electronic or
computing device.

67
(iii)
Data Transmission
The data transmission means emission of data in any direction via
wireless or wired medium. Transmission may occur between source and
destination.
(iv) Analog Signals
Analog signals are a continuously varying signals or waves that
change with time period and used to represent data. An analog signal can
be used to measure changes in some physical quantities such as light,
sound, pressure or temperature.
(v)
Analog Signals

Digital Signals
Fig: 4.1 Analog Signals
A digital signal is an electrical signal that is converted into a pattern
of bits to represent a sequence of discrete values, at any given time. It can
only be one of the finite numbers represented as 0 or 1.
Digital Signals
Fig: 4.2 Digital Signals

Difference between Analog and Digital Signals:
Analog Signal
1 An analog signal is a continuous 1
wave that changes by time
period.
Digital Signal
A digital signal is a discrete
wave that carries information in
binary form.
2 Analog signal has no fixed 2 Digital signal has a finite
range.
3 An analog signal can easily be

signals remain within digital
devices/electronic.
(vi) Data Rate / Bit Rate
Data rate is the rate at which data is transferred. It is normally
measured in bits per second. Bit is the actual binary digit which is the
basic unit of data transmission. Bit can hold either 0 or 1. Data rate can be
ranging from bps (bits per second) for smaller values to kbps (kilo bits per
second) and mbps (megabits per second). It is also called bit rate. Data
rate becomes faster when more bits are transferred in one second.
Teacher
Note
There are many abstract concepts in this chapter. It is
good idea that teachers explain this chapter with the
help of videos available on internet.

69
69
(vii) Baud Rate
The baud rate is the number of signals transmitted per second and
one signal can represent one or more bits. It is used to describe the
maximum change in an electronic signal. For example, if a signal changes
1200 times in one second, it would be measured at 1200 baud.
Difference between Data Rate and Baud Rate:
Data Rate or Bit Rate
1 Bit rate tells the number of bits
transmitted per unit of time
(Second).
1
2 Bit rate is the number bits (O's 2
and 1's) transmitted per second.
Baud Rate
Baud rate is used when we want
to know the number of signal
units transmitted per unit of
time (Second).
Baud rate is the number of
times a signal is traveling
comprised of bits. One signal
can represent more than one
bit.
3 Bit rate = baud rate x the number 3 Baud rate
of bits per signal unit
=
bit rate / the number
of bits per signal unit
(viii) Signal to Noise Ratio
Signal-to-noise ratio (abbreviated SNR or S/N) is a measure used in
engineering that compares the level of a desired signal and the level of
background noise. It is defined as the ratio of signal power to the noise
power, often expressed in decibels.

It is the device that generates and sends a message. It can be a
computer, telephone handset, etc.
(iii) Receiver
Any particular digital electronic device which has capability to
recieve data in form of message. The location of receiving computer is
generally different from the sending computer. Like sender, it can also be
a computer, telephone handset, etc.
(iv) Medium
It is the channel or path through which the message is carried from
sender to the receiver. Some examples include twisted-pair cable, coaxial
cable, radio waves, etc.

71
(v) Protocol
Protocols are the rules and procedures on which computers
exchange data on network. Sender and receiver follow same protocols to
communicate with each other. In other words, a protocol is an agreement
between two parties or venders, using communication devices.
4.1.3 Properties of a Good Communication System
The effectiveness of a data communications system depends on the
fundamental characteristics which include delivery, accuracy and
timeliness.

Description
Making sure that the data is delivered is the
first fundamental characteristic of any
communication network. The system must
be able to deliver data in correct order to
the correct destination.
The system must deliver the data
accurately. Data that has been altered
during transmission and left uncorrected is
not useful.
The data must be delivered in a timely
manner. Late delivered data is useless.

unguided media
Differentiate between guided and unguided media
4.2 TRANSMISSION MEDIUM
Transmission Medium or Communication Channel is a wireless or
physical path between the sender and receiver through which data is sent
and received from one place to another. Data is transmitted normally by
electromagnetic or electrical signals through different types of wires,

72
atmosphere or vacuum. Transmission media is broadly classified into two
groups; guided and unguided as shown in figure 4.4.

Fig: 4.4 Transmission Medium
In guided media signals are transmitted in a narrow pathway by
using physical links. It is also called Wired or Bounded transmission
media. The physical links are the cables that are tangible or have physical
existence. There are three common types of guided media used for the
networks. Each of them has its own characteristics like transmission
speed, effect of noise, physical appearance, cost, etc.
(i) Twisted Pair Cable
As name suggests, this cable is made by two separate wires twisted
together. A twisted pair cable is made up of insulated copper wires. The
insulation and twisting of wires prevent external interference. Each pair of
wires has unique color code. This type of cable is widely used in different
kinds of data and voice infrastructures. There are two types of twisted pair
cables:
(a) Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
(b) Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)

73
(a)
Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
This type of cable can block
interference but it is vulnerable to external
interference. It is mostly used for
telephonic applications. It is less expensive
and easy to install.
(b)
Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)
This type of cable consists of a special
coating to block external interference. It is
used in fast-data-rate ethernet and also in
voice and data channels of telephone lines.
(ii) Coaxial Cable
Coaxial cable is also known as coax. It
has an outer plastic covering containing two
parallel conductors each having a separate
insulated protection cover. Cable TVs and
analog television networks widely use
coaxial cables.
Fiber-Optic Cable
In optical fiber or fiber-optic cable
data is transferred in the form of light. It
uses the concept of reflection of light
through a core made up of glass or plastic.
The core is surrounded by a less dense
glass or plastic covering called the
cladding. It is used for transmission of
large volumes of data at very high speed.

Unguided media is also termed as wireless or unbounded
transmission media. As the name implies, it does not require physical

74
medium such as wire for the transmission of electromagnetic signals.
There are three major types of Unguided Media.
(i) Radio Waves
Radio waves are also called
electromagnetic waves. These are easy to
generate and can penetrate through
buildings. Radio waves are omnidirectional
and propagated in all directions. It means
that sending and receiving antennas do not
need to be aligned. FM, AM radios, television
and cordless phones use radio waves for
transmission.
(ii)
Microwaves
((cv))
Fig: 4.9 Radio Waves
Microwave transmission is a line of sight transmission i.e. the
sending and receiving antennas need to be properly aligned with each
other. The distance covered by the signal is directly proportional to the
height of the antenna. These are mostly used for mobile phone
communications tower and television broadcast. Terrestrial and Satellite
are two types of microwave transmissions.
Terrestrial: Terrestrial microwaves have both stations having antennas
on earth.
Satellite: In satellite system (Figure 4.10), some antenna are on satellite
in orbit and others are on stations on earth. They work at remote places so
it can be used in mobile devices.

75
(iii) Infrared
It uses infrared light to transmit
signals. LED is used to transmit signals and
light-receivers (photodiodes) to receive
signals. They use terahertz frequency. It
cannot penetrate walls or other objects.
Infrared light is transmitted generally line of
sight (point to point). Wireless infrared
communications can be used to establish
short range wireless links or wireless Local
Area Network.

Describe the different types of flaws and faults in
transmission signals.
4.2.3 Transmission Impairments
Sometimes, signals traveling through transmission media lose their
quality. This means that received signal is not same as the signal that was
sent. This phenomenon is called transmission impairments.
Transmission impairments are those defects that occur when data is
transmitted. There are three causes of impairment i.e. attenuation,
distortion and noise.
(i)
Attenuation
Attenuation means loss of energy. A signal loses its energy due to
the resistance of medium while it is transmitted. Its strength decreases
with increase in distance. Amplifiers are used to overcome attenuation
and make signal stronger again. It is measured in decibels.
Original
Attenuated

76
(ii) Distortion
Distortion means change in the shape of the signal. A composite
signal has several frequencies. When it travels through a medium
different component of signal may reach at different time at destination
because each component has different speed in that medium. This is
called distortion. They have different phases at sender and receiver ends.

transmission of data is called noise. It can be induced noise, crosstalk
noise, thermal noise and impulse noise which may damage the signal.

4.3 COMMUNICATION DEVICES
A communication device is any type of hardware capable of
transmitting and receiving data, instructions and information.
4.3.1 Switch
A switch or network switch (Figure 4.15) is a networking device that
connects computers and other devices like
printers, scanners and cameras on a
network. Data cables from all computers and
other devices of network are plugged into the
switch to enable communication between
them.
4.3.2 Router
A Router (Figure 4.16) is a device
that connects two or more networks.
Routers are a combination of hardware
and software. The main function of a
router is to determine the optimal data
path and transfer the information
through that path, also known as
network traffic controller.
4.3.3 Modem
Fig: 4.15 Switch
Fig: 4.16 Router
Modem is short for Modulator and Demodulator. Modulation is the
process of converting digital signals into analog signals. Demodulation is

78
quite opposite; it converts analog signals into digital signals. Modem has
the ability of sending and receiving signals that allows computers to share
information with each other. This sharing of information is possible over
phone lines, cables or satellite connections.
(i)
Dial-up Modem
Dialup modems (Figure 4.17) use standard telephone lines to
transmit and receive information. A dialup modem can be internal or
external. It is important to remember that telephone lines carry only
analog signals, whereas data packets sent by the computer are in digital
form. In order to send these packets across a telephone line, modem
converts digital signals into analog.
(ii) DSL Modem
Fig: 4.17 Dial-up Modem
DSL stands for Digital
Subscriber Line (Figure 4.18). Like
dial-up modem DSL modem also
uses telephone lines to transfer
digital signals. DSL modem has a
built-in network switch which
enables use of twisted pair wires to
deliver data and voice at high speed
as compare to dial-up modem. Some
DSL modems also have wireless
communication functionality.
Fig: 4.18 DSL Modem

79
(iii) ISDN Modem
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN: Figure 4.19) is a digital
phone connection that can transmit data, voice and video over a normal
telephone line at the same time which was not done before. It is faster and
expensive technology. Since ISDN work on digital transmission it converts
analog voice to digital signals before transmission.

Network cards also known as Network Interface Cards (NICs:
Figure 4.20) are hardware devices that connect a computer with the
network. They are installed on the mother board. They are responsible for
establishing a physical connection between the network and the
computer. Computer data is translated into electrical signals and sent to
the network via Network Interface Cards. Modern motherboards have
built-in NICs.

4.4.2 Types of Computer Networks
Computer networks can be categorized by their size as well as their
purpose. The size of a network can be expressed by the geographical area
they occupy and the number of computers that are part of the network.
Networks can cover anything from a handful of devices within a single
room to millions of devices spread across the entire globe. There are three
types of computer networks:
•
•
•
Local Area Network (LAN)
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
Wide Area Network (WAN)
(i) Local Area Network (LAN)
LAN is a group of computer and peripheral devices which are
connected in a limited area such as school, laboratory, home and office
building. Useful resources like internet access, storage space and printers
can be shared through LAN. It can be built with inexpensive hardware
such as hubs, switches, network adapters and network cables. Data and
software are also shared through LAN.
(ii)
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
In MAN, computer network can spread across an entire city, college
campus, or a small region. It can cover the area of several miles and may
include multiple small networks or LANs. MANs offer very fast
communication but they are expensive to establish. Therefore, only large
business organization or universities set up MAN. It also requires security
measures to prevent unauthorized access.
(iii) Wide Area Network (WAN)
A Wide Area Network is used for long distance transmission of data.
WAN helps to cover a larger geographical area and connect cities,
provinces or even countries. Using WAN technology, computers may be
linked together in different countries using satellites, microwaves or
telecommunication links. Therefore, large business, research and

32
82
educational organizations situated at longer distances use WAN. A WAN
may include multiple MANs and LANS. WANs are set up with expensive
devices and need some dedicated connections

Define the term network topology
Develop understanding about physical layout of bus,
ring and star topologies
Differentiate the network topologies according to
their design and physical layout
4.5 Fundamental of Topologies
The physical layout in which computers are connected is called
topology. The topology of network describes the way computers are
connected. Topology is a major design consideration for computer
networking.
4.5.1 Bus Topology
As name suggests, in Bus Topology computers and other devices
are connected with a single cable. The central cable is the backbone of the
network and every device communicates with the other device through
this bus. The advantages of Bus Topology are simplicity, low cost and easy
expansion of the network. The disadvantage of the Bus Topology is that a
breakdown in the bus cable brings the entire network down.
Fig: No. 4.21 Bus Topology

83
4.5.2 Ring Topology
In Ring Topology, computers
are connected in a ring or circle
shape. The signal travels around
the loop in one direction and
passes through each computer.
The recipient of the message
receives the message while another
computer acts like a repeater to
send it to the next computer. The
failure of a link or a computer can
make the entire network non-
functional.
4.5.3 Star Topology
Fig: 4.22 Ring Topology
In a star topology, all the computers are connected to a central
device called hub or switch. To communicate with any computer, the
sender must send information to the hub. Then the hub transmits that
information to the destination. The advantages of star topology are easy to
set up and easy expansion of the network. Another feature of Star
Topology is that if one link to the hub breaks, only the station using that
link is affected not the whole network.

List out the names of standards organizations:
ISO, IEEE, IETF, ITU, ANSI
4.6 STANDARD ORGANIZATIONS
Standards are rules that define the appearance, functionality, or
protocols of some equipment. They are essential for network
communication. Network standards define rules of communications
among computing devices. This ensures that companies (i.e. Cisco and
IBM) that manufacture computing and networking products follow these
uniform standards. By following standards, all hardware become
compatible in the network, allowing efficient networking to take place.
Standard Organization develops, coordinates, revises, amends
and reissues technical standards. These standards are intended to
address the requirements of a group of concerned devices. There are
several organizations working on standardization of computing
equipment to enable the interoperability among different devices
manufactured by different companies in different regions. IEEE, IETF,
ITU and ANSI are the examples of standard organizations.
4.6.1 International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
It covers a wide range of fields. The ISO has members from the
standards committees of various governments across the world. It is even
responsible for developing models which provides high level of system
compatibility, quality enhancement, improved productivity and reduction
in costs. The ISO is also responsible for endorsing and coordinating the
functions of the other standards organizations.
4.6.2 Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (IEEE)
It is an international professional non-profit organization.
Electronics, computer and communication engineers, researchers,
scientists and students are the members of IEEE. This organization
develops communication and information processing standards for all
fields related to electrical and computer engineering.

85
4.6.3 International Engineering Task Force (IETF)
It is a large international community of network designers,
operators, vendors and researchers concerned with the development of
internet architecture and smooth operation of the internet.
4.6.4 International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
This organization is a specialized agency that is responsible for
resolving the issues that concern with information and communication
technologies.
4.6.5 American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
It is the official standards agency for the United States. ANSI is a
completely private, non-profit organization comprised of equipment
manufacturers and users of data processing equipment and services. It
supervises standards for products, services, processes, systems and
personnel in the United States. ANSI membership is comprised of people
from professional societies, industry associations, governmental and
regulatory bodies, and consumer goods.

It is the design of a computer network. It is a framework for the
specification of a network's physical components, their functional
organization and configuration, operational procedures and
communication protocols used. Just like OSI / TCP layered architecture.
4.7.1 ISO's OSI Model
The Open Systems Interconnection model is a conceptual model
developed by ISO. It characterizes and standardizes the communication
functions of a telecommunication and computing network. Its goal is the
interoperability of different communication systems with standard

86
communication protocols. This model divides a communication system

Functions
This layer enables users to access the network with
applications such as email, file transfer, etc. These
applications produce the data, which is
transferred over the network.
It receives information from the application
layer and converts it to uniform network format
(ASCII or Unicode) which is acceptable by rest of OSI
model and destination. Encryption and decryption
are also the responsibility of this layer. This layer
also reduces number of transfer bits by compression.
This layer establishes, maintains and ends a session
or logical connection between applications on two
computers. It manages who can transmit data at a
certain time and for how long. This layer adds
checkpoints. If session fails only data after the most
recent checkpoint need to be transmitted.
It ensures the reliable transmission of data. Transport
layer manages error control, flow control and quality of
the service. If the data is not properly transmitted it
requests to resend.
The function of this layer is the selection of the shortest
and suitable path from source to destination, from the
number of routes available. It is also responsible to
convert logical address (IP address) to physical address
(MAC address).
This layer is responsible to transmit data using physical
addresses. Data Link Layer ensures error free
transmission of packets. Packet in this layer is referred
as Frame.
It is responsible for converting electrical signals into bits.
It also defines the cable types to be used as transmission
media, cards, topology and other physical aspects.

87
4.7.2 TCP/IP Model
TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect
network devices on the internet. These are set of rules and procedures.
TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing
end-to-end communications. It also identifies how data should be broken
into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the
destination. With reference to OSI layers, we can understand the
functions of TCP/IP layers.

4.8 NETWORK ADDRESSING
Network addresses are like our house addresses. They must be
unique and distinctive. This avoids confusion for the postman. A network
address is any Logical or Physical Address that uniquely identifies it from

88
888
others. This address is needed to distinguish a network node or device on
a computer network. It is a numeric or symbolic number or address that is
assigned to any device that seeks access to network or is the part of a
network. Remember, Physical and Logical Address are different.
Difference between Physical Address and Logical Address:
Physical Address

hardware address.
4. Physical address is a 48 bit
mac address.
5. It is globally Unique and
permanent.
4.8.1 IPV4 Address
4. Logical address is a 32 bit IP
Address.
5. It is unique in one network and
temporary.
An IP address is a unique number or address used to identify a
device on a network. The device could be a computer, printer, smart
phone, tablet, etc.
Every device connected to the internet must have an IP address to
communicate with other devices. IP address acts as a telephone number
or a car registration number. It shows ownership and location. IP address
allows a device to communicate and be located by other devices on the
internet. IPV4 stands for Internet Protocol version 4.
An IPV4 address is made up of 32 binary bits, which is divided into
two parts, network and host. The network portion of the address mentions

89
the computer network and the host
portion identifies the computer or any
other computing device. IP version 4
(IPV4) addresses are comprised of
four number segments separated by
dots. Example of an IP address is

SUMMARY
Fig: 4.24 IP Address
Communication is the process of sharing a message. Data
communication refers to the exchange of digital messages between two
devices.
◆ Analog signals are continuously varying signals or waves that change
with time period and used to represent data.
A digital signal is an electrical signal that is converted into a pattern of
bits to represent a sequence of discrete value.
Data rate refers to the rate at which data is transferred. It is normally
measured in bits per second transferred.
The baud rate is the number of signals transmitted per second and one
signal can represent one or more bits.
A communication system has following five component; message,
sender, receiver, medium, protocol.
The effectiveness of a data communications system depends on the
fundamental characteristics which include delivery, accuracy and
timeliness.
♦ Transmission medium or communication channel is a wireless or
physical path between the sender and receiver through which data is
sent and received from one place to another.
Transmission media is broadly classified into two groups guided and
unguided.

96

Twisted Pair Cable is made by putting two separate wires together in a
twisted pattern.
Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) is type of cable consists of a special jacket
to block external interference.
Coaxial cable has an outer plastic covering containing two parallel
conductors each having a separate insulated protection cover.
♦ In fiber optic cable data is transferred in the form of light.
♦
Radio waves are also called electromagnetic waves.
• Radios, television and cordless phones use radio waves for
transmission.
Microwave transmission is a line of sight transmission i.e. the sending
and receiving antennas need to be properly aligned with each other.
♦ Infrared light is transmitted generally line of sight (point to point).
♦ Transmission impairments are those defects that occur when data is
transmitted. There are three kinds of impairment as attenuation,
distortion and noise.
♦ Attenuation means loss of energy or a weakened signal.
◆ Distortion means change in the shape of the signal.
♦ Influence signal that mixes up with the original signal during the
transmission of data is called noise.
A switch or network switch is a networking device that connects
computers and other devices like printers, scanners, and cameras of a
computer network.
A Router is device that connects two or more networks.
Dialup modems use standard telephone lines to transmit and receive
information.
DSL stands for Digital Subscriber Line. DSL modems are the next step
in modem technology.
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a digital phone
connection that can transmit data, voice and video over a normal
telephone line at the same time.
Network cards also known as Network Interface Cards (NICs) are
hardware devices that connect a computer with the network.
A computer network is a system of computers and related equipment
connected by a communication links to share data and other
resources.

91
• Computer networks can be categorized by their size as well as their
purpose.
There are three types of computer networks Local Area Network (LAN),
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN).
A Local Area Network (LAN) is a group of computer and peripheral
devices which are connected in a limited area such as school,
laboratory, home, and office building.
A Metropolitan Area Network or MAN consists of a computer network
across an entire city, college campus, or a small region.
A Wide Area Network is used for long distance transmission of data.

5.1 COMPUTER SECURITY
The computer has become an important part of our life. We store
important data on our computers in the shape of documents, pictures,
programs, etc. Therefore, we expect that all our information must remain
safe and our computer runs properly without any problem. Few threats
can cause problems for our computers. These threats may be different
types of viruses or unauthorized use of a computer. To prevent our
computer from such threats, we need to abide by computer security.
Computer security is the protection against theft or damage to our
computer hardware, software and information present on it.
5.1.1 Importance of Computer Security
Computer security is important for our computer's overall health. It
keeps our information protected and helps prevent viruses and malware,
which allows programs to run quicker and smoother. It safeguards
confidential and sensitive information.
The advancement in science and technology has changed the ways
we live and carry out day to day activities. We rely on computers and
mobile phones to carry out many activities. While using computers and
mobile phones we access a lot of information which we do not want to
share with others. This information may include our passwords, banking
details, contacts, pictures, etc. To protect this information we need to
make our devices secured that no one can damage or access this
information without our consent.

97
Computer Security is important as it enables people to perform their work
in safe environments. It helps in the execution of essential business
processes. Here are a few reasons why computer security should be taken
seriously.
5.1.2 Cybercrime:
As communication, trade, and services are relying more on
computers and networks, the cybercrimes are growing too. Cybercrime is
the crime that is committed through a computer and network.
Cybercriminal uses devices to gain unauthorized access to important
information. Stealing passwords and important information, hacking
social media accounts, accessing anyone else's account and making
transactions, committing online frauds are some of the examples of
cybercrime. Cybercrime is illegal and also punishable. According to
Pakistan's Cybercrime Law, any offender who interrupts the privacy of a
person or organization and harms their repute may be sent to jail for three
to five years including a heavy fine.
(i)
Hackers:
Hacker can be a person who has in-depth knowledge of computer
systems, networks, and programs. Hacker maybe someone who uses his
or her extensive skills to identify and overcome a network loophole.
Hackers constantly seek further knowledge and freely share what they
have discovered. Hackers are generally considered as bad people however,
hackers can also help us to improve the data and network security.
Government and business organizations are now hiring ethical hackers,
also known as white hat hackers, to prevent data theft.
(ii)
Crackers
Crackers are persons who gain unauthorized access to another
system. They bypass passwords or licenses of computer programs,
change source code or intentionally breach computer security. They do it
with negative intentions. Crackers can also make targeted system
unavailable or non-functional. They commit these activities generally for
money but they may do it for fame or just for challenge or fun.

98
5.1.3 Computer Crime in Real Life
As technology is growing the data security has become so crucial.
We can be a victim of computer crime at any time. Computer crime can
range from an international data security threat to a personal offense. In
2013, hackers managed to hack 1 billion email accounts of the users.
Likewise, in 2017, the WannaCry virus attacked the National Health
Service in the United Kingdom which made the whole system non-
functional for several days. As far as personal offenses are concerned,
hacking the social media and mail accounts are so common. There are
many genres of computer crime or now called cyber-crimes. Some
examples of such crimes in real life are discussed here.
(i) Hacking
Hacking is perhaps the most common crime in the computer world.
Hackers can steal our WiFi, email or social media accounts' passwords.
Hackers also attack a website and take it down. However, the scope of
hacking is much wider. The hackers can also steal sensitive information
from government and business organizations, make fraudulent
transactions and erase data on the cloud or network computers.
(ii) Credit and Debit Card Scam
Keeping debit or credit cards is a common practice but insecure use
of these cards can be dangerous. If a person has information about our
debit or credit card he or she can make fraudulent transactions. There are
various ways to get this information. One way is through scamming.
Scammers set small machines inside an ATM or credit card machine.
These machines copy the data which is then misused by the scammers.
Debit and credit cards are also secured with PIN codes. User has to keep
this code secret otherwise any person can use the card for online shopping
and other purposes. All he or she needs to know our credit card number,
PIN and security code printed on the back of the cards.
(iii) Phishing
Phishing is a method of trying to gather personal information using
false e-mails and websites. In Phishing, perpetrators contact the target

99
99
person through email, telephone or text message and pose as a legitimate
and trusted individual. He or she asks the target to provide sensitive data
such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card
details and passwords for different reasons. The information is then used
to access different accounts and can result in identity theft and financial
loss.
(iv) Clickjacking
Have you ever seen any video tagged as "OMG? You won't believe
what this boy has done!" or did you find a button on a website that asked
to click to claim a reward you had never applied for? This is a kind of fraud
which is called Clickjacking. Usually, culprits target children or novice
internet users to click on a link containing malware or trick them into
sharing private information via social media sites.
(v) Cyber Bullying or Harassment
Electronic means like a computer, mobile phone or internet are also
used for online bullying or harassment. Harmful bullying behavior can
include posting rumors, threats, passing inappropriate remarks, leaking
personal information, blackmailing and committing hate speech. The
perpetrator does it with the intent to cause harm to the victim. Victims
may experience lower self-esteem, intent to commit suicide and a variety
of negative emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry
and depressed.
5.1.4 Cyber Attack
Cyber-attacks occur when a cybercriminal uses computer or any
device to launch attacks to other single or multiple computer networks.
The culprit tries to enter in a computer system and network through
cracking, scam links, phishing or any other method. Generally cyber-
attacks are committed for getting any benefit or causing harm to victim
computer, network or websites. A cyber-attack either disables the
targeted computer, deletes information or knocks it offline. It may also
steal information from the computer or network.

100
5.1.4 What to do? In Case of Becoming a Victim
The perpetrator of cyber crime always asks to
keep his or her contact secret otherwise the victim
may face heavy loss. The response of the victim of
cyber crime, bullying or harassment is very crucial.
There are ways to get rid of such miseries. First
thing is to report such incidents to the trusted
people that are highly likely parents and teachers.

Define computer virus and how to prevent them
Define and differentiate various types of viruses:
Malware, Virus, Worm, Adware and Spyware
濕
Identify that a virus, worm, adware, spyware and
Malware can spread through different ways
•
Recognize that the antivirus software like Avast,
Norton, MacAfee and others can help to safeguard
against viruses
5.2 MALWARE
The term malware is the contraction of malicious software. Malware
is a broad term that encompasses computer viruses, worms, spyware,
adware and others. Malware is a program that is written generally to
cause a mess. They can be so dangerous that they can also damage
devices. However commonly malware encrypt, steal or delete data, hijack
core functions of computing and disturb different activities.

101
5.2.1 Different Malware
Types of malware can include computer viruses, worms, adware,
and spyware.
(i)
Computer Virus
A computer virus is a computer program that can spread across
computers and networks by making copies of itself, usually without the
user's knowledge. It can also modify other computer programs, insert its
own code and change computer settings. Viruses are harmful. They can
range from displaying irritating messages to make all the documents
inaccessible or even delete them. Viruses generally latch on a host file and
when they execute they infect other files or programs. Boot Sector,
Resident, Macro Viruses and File Infector are some examples of viruses.
(ii) Worm
A computer worm spreads copies of itself from computer to
computer. A worm can replicate itself without any human interaction. It
does not need to attach itself to a file or program to cause damage. It can
do several malicious tasks, such as dropping other malware, copying itself
onto devices physically attached to the affected system, deleting files, and
consuming internal storage and memory resources.
(iii) Adware
Adware is advertising-supported software. They present endless
ads and pop-up windows that could potentially consume memory and
processing resources. Adware can also change the different settings of
internet browsers like homepage and default search engine. Normally,
these are not as dangerous as other malware. However, Adware annoys
the user and slows down the processing. The advertisements produced by
adware are sometimes in the form of a pop-up or sometimes in little
windows that may not be closed. Adware programs include games,
desktop toolbars or utilities. Commonly, adware is web-based and collects
web browser data to target advertisements, especially pop-ups.

102
(iv) Spyware
Spyware is a malware that monitors a device and steals important
information about a person or organization without their consent and
sends such information to another person or organization. Spyware takes
control over a mobile phone or computer without the user's knowledge.
They capture information like web browsing history, e-mail messages,
usernames and passwords and online payment information. Spyware can
come through cookies or even when we install software without reading its
terms and conditions. System monitors, cookies trackers, rootkits and
key-loggers are few examples of Spyware.
5.2.2 Ways of viruses spread
A computer virus is just like a flu virus. It is designed to spread from
one device to another device and can replicate itself. Any device that is
infected from a virus can infect other devices. It means that viruses come
from outside. How do they come? Here are some ways:
(i)
USB Flash Disk and CDs
USB Flash Disks are the most common media to transfer files. An
infected computer can spread a virus to a clean USB flash disk that is
inserted and likewise, an infected USB can transmit the virus onto a clean
computer. The AutoRun function in Windows OS launches installers and
other programs automatically when a flash drive or CD is inserted. This
action can initiate a virus spreading process onto the computer. Copying
infected files from the USB or CD can also infect the computer.
Teacher
Note
Teacher should provide the information of viruses like
Trojan horses, Rootkit, Backdoors, and Bots. This may
be given as an assignment.

103
(ii) Internet Downloads
Computer viruses also spread through files or software downloads
from the Internet. They can be attached to software or files that we
download. The viruses come from the internet can also make our
computer accessible to hackers. Though, almost every antivirus software
provides a shield against malicious downloads, it is highly recommended
that the software and files must be downloaded from trusted sources.
(iii) Computer Network
Users must be careful because files picked from a Local Area
Network (LAN) may be infected and cause damage to our computer or
operating system. The same can happen to transfer files from one mobile
device to another mobile device via Bluetooth etc.
(iv)
Email Attachments
Email attachments have been a popular
medium to spread viruses. Viruses can easily
be transferred from one computer to another
through email attachments. The infected
emails may come from an unknown or fake
email address. Perpetrators who spread these
viruses use either fake email or change a few
letters in a trusted email address. People in
our contact list may also send us infected files
as they may not be aware of it themselves.
Users must check the origin of the email before
opening the attached files or clicking any link
that is given in the email. Especially spam
mails must be checked carefully before
clicking on its attachment.
5.2.3 Antivirus
Virus!
Fig: 5.2 Viruses can
spread through emails
Antiviruses are utility software designed to protect computers from
any potential threats of data or hardware loss. It is highly recommended
that the user must install an antivirus on an operating system like

104
Windows. Antivirus software works in the background and monitors every
software that is running and the emails or data coming from the internet.
In case of any suspicious activity, antivirus alerts the user and asks for
action. Normally, antivirus tries to clean the files and if not succeeded it
quarantines the infected file. This is highly recommended that the user
should update the antivirus regularly. Many antivirus software can be
found on the internet and most of them are generally free. However, in the
free version of antivirus, some advanced features are not available. Paid
customers are called premier users and they get advance security
features.
The most common antiviruses are:
(i)
Avast
Avast is one of the largest security
companies in the world. Avast's management
claims that they are using next-gen
technologies to fight cyber-attacks in real-
time. They also claim that Avast has an
immense cloud-based machine learning
engine that receives a constant stream of data
from hundreds of millions of users. This
facilitates learning at extraordinary speeds
and makes artificial intelligence engine
smarter and faster to stop viruses.
(ii) Norton
Norton antivirus has been a popular
antivirus utility since 1991. This is a part of a
large family of security and other utility
software by Symantec Corporation. Norton
Antivirus is easy to use, has the configuration
options that experts need, comes highly rated
by the testing labs and is exactly designed to
have the least possible impact on your system
performance.

(iii) McAfee
McAfee claims that it provides a
combination of antivirus, privacy and identity
tools and features. This enables users to stay
protected against the latest virus, malware,
ransomware and spyware attacks while keeping
their identity and privacy protected and personal.
5.2.4 Safeguard against Malware
Keeping ourselves safe from
malware and viruses is mostly in our
hands. More than 90% of computers are
infected due to the user's mistake. Our
computers have caught a virus if they
start slowing down, behave unusually,
crash during processes or restart several
times, show annoying messages and
some of our documents disappear or
become inaccessible. We must avoid this
situation to be created. Some simple
measures can prevent our system from
malware and viruses.

Run scheduled scans regularly with your anti-virus software.
Keep your operating system updated.
Do not click on internet links which have unusual labels, images or
captions.
Do not open email attachments or click on hyperlinks from
unknown senders.
Scan USB flash drive, SD cards and mobile phones before opening.
Use your spam blocking or filtering tools to block unsolicited emails,
instant messages and pop-ups.
Only download files and programs from trusted sources on the
internet.
•
Never use an open WiFi.

106
5.2.5 Keeping the Backup of Data
Besides this, we should also take some measures to recover data
from any potential loss. Some steps in this regard are:
.
•
Create a system restore point regularly and check if it is not
disabled.
Write important data on CDs or DVDs. Since they are write-
protected, they do not catch viruses.
Have the back-up of important files at more than one place.
You can also save documents on cloud storage like Google Drive and
Microsoft OneDrive.

List out the different authentication mechanisms
Differentiate between username and password,
personal identification number and biometric
authentication mechanisms
5.3 AUHENTICATION MECHANISM
The authentication mechanism is the hardware or software-based
mechanism that forces users to prove their identity before accessing data
on a device. The process makes sure the only authenticated user gets
access to data or devices.
5.3.1 Types of Security Mechanism
There are many ways a computer security system may authenticate
a user. Some of them are:
(i) Username and Password:
A username and password are the pair of keywords known by the
user. They are presented to the computer to authenticate the user.
Usernames and passwords are the default authentication mechanism on

107
the web today. However, recent large scale computer attacks have made
usernames and passwords an unacceptable authentication mechanism.
Additional authentication mechanisms are needed to fully authenticate.
(ii) Personal Identification Number
PIN stands for Personal
Identification Number. It is a
security code for verifying your
identity. Similar to a password, your
PIN should be kept secret because it
allows access to important services
such as financial transactions and
confidential emails. The PIN provides
security when a credit/debit card is
lost or stolen because the PIN must
be known before making money
withdrawal or transfer.
(iii) Biometric Verification

Fig: 5.7 PIN Identification
Unlike authentication processes, biometrics verification makes
sure that the real person gets access to the data or device. Biometric
authentication relies on the unique biological characteristics of a person.
Biometric authentication systems captures data in real-time and compare
it with existing data in database. If both samples of the biometric data
match, authentication is confirmed. Scanning fingerprints are the most
common way of biometric. However, some other advance ways include
retinal scans and iris, facial and voice recognitions.

5.4 PROFESSIONAL ETHICS IN COMPUTER FIELD
Professional ethics involve the personal and corporate principles
and rules that guide behavior within the context of a profession. The role
of a professional code of ethics is to clarify values and rules and can be
used as a framework for discipline. Computing professionals' actions
change the world. To act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider
impacts of their work, consistently supporting the public good. Here are
some guiding principles:
.
.
Contribute to society and human well-being, acknowledging that all
people are stakeholders in computing.
Be honest and trustworthy.
Respect the equipment.
•
Avoid causing any harm.
.
•
•
.
.
.
Be fair and act not to discriminate, bully or harass.
Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions,
creative works, and computing artifacts.
Respect privacy and maintain confidentiality.
Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and
ethical practice.
Create opportunities for other individuals or groups to grow as
professionals.
Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of work life.
Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all
professional computing work.
Access computing and communication resources only when
authorized.
Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related
technologies and their consequences.

109
5.4.1 Define Information Accuracy
The information accuracy is the type of
measurement that assures the information is
correct and true. It is also necessary that the
information should not be generated from the
malicious data. For information accuracy, the
data must be from reputable sources.
In the era of information explosion, we need to
be more careful while using or disseminating
information. The use of unreliable sources
results in inaccurate information. Especially, Fig: 5.9 Ensuring information
the accuracy of information shared on social Accuracy is necessary
media is often questionable.
5.4.2 Intellectual Property Right
When any person develops software, writes a book or research
paper or invents any method or the machine, it becomes the intellectual
property of that person. Intellectual property is intangible creations of the
human intellect. Just like other property the intellectual property can be
stolen. To prevent theft or illegal use or spread of intellectual property,
Intellectual Property Right is exercised. Through these rights, intellectual
property is protected with the help of copyrights, patents, and
trademarks. They allow creators or
owners of patents, trademarks or
copyrighted works to benefit from
their work or investment. Under
these rights, no other person or
organization can copy or reproduce
any other's intellectual property.
Intellectual property rights are
acclaimed worldwide. In Pakistan,
Intellectual Property Organization
(IPO) regulates the matters
regarding intellectual property rights.
Fig: 5.10 Intellectual Property
should be regarded

110
(i)
Patent
A patent is a grant of exclusive rights for an
invention to make, use and sell the invention for a
limited period, in Pakistan 20 years. Owning a patent
gives the patent holder the right to stop someone else
from making, using or selling his or her invention
without permission. To protect students and scholars,
the Higher Education Commission also offers support
to get patents registered with Intellectual Property
Organization (IPO). The patentable process or
invention must be novel, possess inventive steps and
can be used in industries.
(ii)
Copyright
Copyright is a legal instrument that provides
legal rights to the creator of artwork, literature, or a
work that conveys information or ideas. In simple
words, copyright is the right of copying. Copyright
gives control over how the work is used. Copyright
intends to advance the progress of knowledge by
giving an author of a work an economic incentive to
create new works. The sign is also often displayed
on copyrighted objects.
(iii)
Trademark
Trademark identifies a product or service
and distinguishes it from other products and
services. Trademarks are protected by intellectual
property rights which identifies that the product
or service belongs to a specific organization. It can
be an easily recognizable word, phrase, logo, or
symbol and often mentioned as TM (Trade Mark).
Trademark helps organizations to market their
products and services locally and globally.
Developing trademarks is creative work and can
be done professionally. There are many software
available for developing Trademarks.

5.4.3 Software Piracy
Software piracy is referred to the illegal use, copying or distribution
of copyrighted software. Software piracy is a huge threat to the software
industry. It causes a significant loss of revenue for developers and
vendors. Because of piracy, vendors have fewer resources to devote to
research and development of new products. Since they earn less profit,
they are forced to pass these costs on to their customers.
Software companies have tried various techniques to stop software
piracy but most of them have remained unsuccessful. They applied for
copy protection which demands the user to enter certain keys or
credentials. Today, most software require registration which is mainly
online. However, these measures could not stop software piracy.
Using pirated software is also risky for users. Aside from the legal
consequences of using pirated software, users of pirated software lose
some practical benefits as well. Pirated software may not work properly or
stop working at any time. Furthermore, pirated software users cannot
access customer support, upgrades, technical documentation, training,
and bug fixes.
5.4.4 Plagiarism
Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work or ideas as your own
without full acknowledgment to the author or conceiver. Academic
honesty demands that the users of any ideas, words and data should
acknowledge the originators. Plagiarism is unethical and can have serious
consequences. Colleges and universities encourage students to submit
their original work and cite the ideas and words borrowed from any other
sources. Failing to this may cause serious penalties. There are online
services to check and fix the plagiarism issues. Academic organizations
hire the plagiarism detection service. One of the most used services is
Turnitin.

Develop the understanding about HTML
Apply the various steps involved in creating a web page
Develop understanding about HTML tags
Recognize the basic structure of an HTML document
6.2 INTRODUCTION TO HTML
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to
create web pages that are displayed by web browsers mainly on internet.
6.2.1 Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
It is standard markup language for text documents. It allows the
user to create structured content by adding headings, paragraphs, links,
blockquotes and other media. It takes advantage of simple code
structures called tags and attributes to achieve formatting, graphic and
navigation effects on web pages.
6.2.2 Steps Involved In Creating Web Page In HTML
Creating a simple web page using HTML is very easy. It requires a
text editor, a file with .html extension and a web browser to view that page.
Step 1: Text Editor
Start by simply creating a new blank file in a text editor of your
choice. A simple text editor like notepad can be used to start coding HTML
for a web page.
Step 2: Write HTML code in Text Editor
Example:
<html>
<head>
<title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
Welcome to my first web page.
</body>
</html>

122
Step 3: Save HTML Page
Go to File menu and click on Save. Make sure to provide .htm or
.html extension for the file being saved. This will save the document as a
web page instead of a plain text file.
Step 4: View HTML Page in Browser
Open the saved HTML file in your default web browser. The web
browser will automatically translate HTML codes to correctly display the
web page.
My Website
+
file:///C:/example.html
Welcome to my first web page.
A
6.2.3 HTML Tags
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. These
elements are defined by placing HTML tags in our document. These tags
are placed inside angular brackets (<>). Some tags also allow further
customization by adding attributes to them. An HTML tag has the
following structure:
Simple Tag: <tag-name>content</tag-name>
Tag with Attribute: <tag-name
value">content</tag-name>
attribute-name=
"attribute
The above syntaxes show the structure of opening a tag, defining
attribute values, placing content inside the element represented by that
tag and its closing structure. Most of HTML tags always require a closing
tag while some HTML tags such as <br> are empty tags which means that
they don't require a closing tag.

Align the portion of text in center of web page
Write subscript and superscript text in a web page
6.3 DESIGNING AND FORMATTING
Some HTML tags introduce content directly into the web page while
others enhance the design and format of that content. Some most
commonly used HTML tags which change the looks of the web page are
explained here.
Tag
<!DOCTYPE
html>
<html>
<head>
<body>
Description
It specifies the HTML version used so the web
browsers can show the web page according to HTML
standards. All HTML documents must start with this
tag.
All HTML documents start with <html> tag and end
with </html> tag.
It is used to define additional information about the
web page. It contains a set of tags such as <title>,
<meta>, <style>,<script>, etc.
The main content of the web page is contained
between <body> and </body> .
6.3.1 Titles and Footers
Tag
<title>
<footer>
Description
It defines the title of a web page. Titles are very
important as they appear on top of the browser
window and displayed on search engine result pages.
It defines the footer for a web page. e.g. "Copyright
2020. All rights reserved."

124
6.3.2 Paragraphs and Line Breaks
<p>
<br>
<hr>
Tag
6.3.3 Headings
Tag
<h1> <h6>
Description
It defines a paragraph of text in a webpage. It always
starts from a new line and adds space before and
after its text.
It defines a line break and starts the following
content from a new line. Unlike <p> tag, it does not
add space before or after the break.
It draws a horizontal line where it is defined. It is
used to differentiate between sections of the page.
Description
It is used to define six levels of HTML headings (h1,
h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6) with <h1> being heaviest
heading and <h6> being the lightest heading.
6.3.4 Text Formatting
<b>,
<u>
Tag
<pre>

<sup>
Description
These tags are used to bold, italicize and underline
text respectively.
It is used to define a preformatted text. The web
browser displays such text with spaces and line
breaks as defined in HTML codes.
It is used to define the font, size and color of its text.
This tag can be composed with three attributes: size,
color and face. This tag is supported till version 4.1
of HTML.
It is used to align its text to the horizontal center of
the web page. This tag is supported till version 4.1 of
HTML.
It defines subscript text which is under the baseline
of other text and has a smaller size. e.g. H₂O
It defines superscript text which is slightly above the
normal line of other text and has a smaller size. e.g.

Mechanical Era (Dark Age)
Men has been trying to invent machines that can solve mathematical problems. In mechanical era, human became successful to make simple machine that
can help performing simple arithmetic operation, in other words computing. These machines were manually operated since the electricity was not invented.
Some of the important machine of this era are:
Abacus, Napier's bones (1612 AD), Slide Rule (1622 AD), etc.

Differentiate among unordered list, ordered list,
definition list and nested list
Create unordered, ordered, definition and nested
lists
6.4 CREATING LISTS
Lists are very useful in displaying point by point information such
as to-do list, list of ingredients for a recipe, list of categories, etc. HTML
provides three different types of list elements namely Unordered Lists,
Ordered Lists and Description Lists. The web browsers automatically add
indents, spaces and markers to HTML lists.
6.4.1 Unordered List
An unordered list is a list of related items in which the order of items
is irrelevant. It is defined by <ul> tag and each of its list item is defined by
<li> tag. The web browser will display these list items as bullet points.
Example:
Output:
<h5>Commonly used components of
My Website
x +
Microsoft Office</h5>
///C:/example.html
<ul>
Commonly used components of Microsoft Office
<li>Word</li>
<li>Excel</li>
<li>PowerPoint</li>
<li>Access</li>
Word
• Excel
• PowerPoint
• Access
</ul>
6.4.2 Ordered List
An ordered list also displays a list of related items. It is used where
the order of the list is important e.g. names of students in order of their
exam ranks. It is defined by <ol> tag and each of its list item is defined by
<li>. The web browser will display these list items with numbers starting
from 1 instead of bullet points.

127
Ordered lists can also be defined with two of its attributes: start and
reversed. Start attribute defines the starting number of first list item.
Reversed attribute is used to display the list in descending order.
The list items for ordered list can also be defined with a value
attribute which is used to place that item at a specific position or number
in the list.
Example:
<h5>Steps to create HTML file </
h5>
<ol>
<li>Text Editor</li>
Output:
My Website
x +
file:///C:/example.ht
Steps to create HTML file
X
<li>New File</li>
<li>HTML codes</li>
<li>Save as .html</li>
</ul>
6.4.3 Description List
1. Text Editor
2. New File
3. HTML codes
4. Save as.html
Description lists are used to display different terms and their
descriptions just like in a dictionary or glossary. It is defined by <dl> tag
and each of its list items is composed of two elements: term and
description.
Term is defined by <dt> tag and its description is defined by <dd>
tag. In description lists, a term can have one or more descriptions and a
description can have one or more terms.
Example:
<dl>
<dt>Operating System</dt>
<dd>An Operating System is software which performs all the basic
tasks like boots the computer, file management, memory management,
process management, and controlling peripheral devices such as hard
disk, printer, etc.</dd>

6.4.4 Nested Lists
A very powerful feature of HTML lists is their ability to nest one into
another. Any of the list type can contain any other list type as its list item.
It is defined by placing the new list tag inside the <li> tag of previous list.
Web browsers automatically indent nested lists and assign appropriate
marker to those nested list items as well.
Example:
<h5>Guided Media</h5>
<ul>
Output:
My Website
<li>Twisted Pair Cable
<ul>
Guided Media
<li>Unshielded Twisted Pair</li>

6.5 IMAGE AND BACKGROUND
Images and backgrounds give a visual appeal to the websites.
Sometimes images can present a better understanding than long and
uninteresting texts.
6.5.1 Images
Images can be inserted in an HTML document by using <img> tag.
This does not create a copy of image. Instead, it only creates a reference to
original image placed somewhere in the computer's storage.
The <img> tag is an empty tag which means that it does not require a
closing</img> tag. It contains five attributes out of which two are required
and three are optional.
6.5.2 Attributes of Image Tag
Attribute Value

version 4.1 of HTML).
Syntax: <img src="image.jpg" border="2">

130
Example:
Output:
<img src="bridge.jpg" alt="Bridge" width="600">
My Website
file:///C:/example.html
6.5.3 Backgrounds
The web browsers display an HTML document with white
background by default. However, this can easily be changed to a different
color or even an image with the help of bgcolor and background attributes
of the <body> tag.
bgcolor: This attribute is used to change the color of the entire
web page. Its color value can be defined as RGB code, hexadecimal
code or by color name.
For instance, to set the background color of the web page to green
we can use any one of these values: rgb(0,255,0) : #00FF00 :
green
e.g. <body bgcolor="green">
background: This attribute is used to display an image as the
background of the web page. Its value will be the reference or URL
of the background image.
e.g. <body background="image.jpg">
Both of these attributes are supported till version 4.1 of HTML.

6.6 HYPERLINKS
Hyperlinks allow a user to navigate from one web page to another. It
also enables users to navigate to different sections within the same web
page. Hyperlinks convert text or other media into clickable objects.
6.6.1 Definition
A hyperlink in HTML is defined by <a> tag and its href attribute.
The value of href is the reference of another web page or a different section
within the same page.

Links to external document: To send a user to any other web page, use
the URL of that page as the value for href attribute.
e.g.<a href="http://www.google.com">Goto Google</a>
Links within the same document: Setting the link within the same page
requires two steps:
1. Use id attribute of any HTML tag to give a name to the section of the
page, where a user should reach after clicking on the link.
2. Create a hyperlink and set the above name as href attribute of this
link, starting with hash (#) symbol.
e.g. <p id="navigate">Send user here on click</p>
<a href="#navigate">Go to the linked paragraph</a>

percentage
Draw a border around the table
Control the distance between data in a cell using cell
padding attribute
Control space between adjacent cells using cells pacing
attribute
Create data cells that span given number of rows or
column using colspan and rowspan attributes
Tables allow displaying the content (like text, image, links) in the
form of rows and columns. The coordinating place of a row with a column
is called a cell. These cells contain some content of the webpage. In HTML,
a table is defined by <table> tag.
6.7.1 Rows and Columns
A row is the collection of all horizontal cells of a table. A table can
contain any
number of rows. All the rows in a table have an equal number
of cells. It is defined by <tr> tag which is placed inside the <table> tag.
A column is the collection of all vertical cells of a table. A table can contain
any number of columns as well. It is defined by <td> tag which is placed
inside the <tr> row tag.
6.7.2 Table Heading
HTML table allows defining a header for the columns of our table. A
header cell is defined by <th> tag and is placed inside a <tr> row tag. It is
used to differentiate from the content placed inside normal <td> data
cells. To make the entire header row stand out from rest of the table
contents, defined <th> tags for all columns of the first <tr> row tag of any
<table> tag.

133
6.7.3 Table Data
The content is placed inside a cell in a table by using <td> table data
tag. A cell can contain any type of data such as text, image, media, link,
etc.

SUMMARY
WWW stands for world-wide web and is a way of accessing different
websites through internet.
There are multiple aspects involved in using accessing information
through internet like Web Server, Web Hosting, Website and Web
Browser.
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and is the format in which
external resources like web pages, images, other media and supporting
files are referenced.
There are different types of specialized websites such as Portal, News,
Informational, Educational, Personal, Business, Blogs, Forums,
Entertainment and Social.
HTML is the language in which web pages are coded.
◆ Any text editor can be used to create HTML files however there are
specialized editors also available.
An HTML file must be of.htm or .html extension.
A web browser is used to view HTML pages.
The codes used in HTML are called tags and are denoted by angular
brackets (<>).
There are various HTML tags. Some define the appearance of the
content. Some carry actual content such as text, images, videos, etc.
Some provide additional information about the web pages.
There are three kinds of HTML lists namely unordered list, ordered list
and description list.
Unordered lists display the list of items in which the sequential order of
its items does not matter.
Ordered lists display the items in numerically ordered sequence.
♦ Description Lists are less commonly used and are used to define terms
and their descriptions such as in a dictionary.
HTML lists can be nested into one another.
HTML pages can make use of images to decorate and provide greater
meaning to their content.

138
Hyperlinks give the ability to any HTML object of being clickable.
Hyperlinks provide means of navigation from one page to another or
from one section in a page to another within the same page.
HTML tables can be used to display data, information or content in a
tabular format. Tables organize the content into rows and columns.
HTML Frames can be used to display the entire contents of another web
page within a web page.
◆ Framesets define the layout to display different frames and their
contents.
◆ There are different tools available which facilitate the designing and
development of web pages and websites.

Define terms flat file system and database system
Differentiate between flat file system and database
system
Discuss the advantages of database system over flat
file system
Differentiate between database and database
management system (DBMS)
7.1 DATABASE
A database stores data in organized form. A database is composed
of tables which contain rows and columns. These rows and columns are
called records and fields respectively. Most databases contain multiple
tables. For example, a general store database may include tables for
purchase, sales and stock records. Each of these tables has different fields
that are relevant to the information stored in the table. Generally, a
database is an electronic system that facilitates easy access,
manipulation and updating of data.
Use of Database
Nowadays, everyone is familiar with term database, it is
mathematically developed data structure which converts raw input data
into meaningful information for a particular organization. These days,
database can be seen in every field of life, for example in industries,
health, agriculture, schooling, business and banking.
The databases can be developed according to the size of its records
for a particular organization. Databases can be small in size with a few
records or very large like NADRA (National Database Registration
Authority) databases which keep the multi millions of records.
A database is playing a leading role to enhance the efficiency and
performance of any organization. The goal of database is to minimize the
loss and increase the productivity and efficiency of any organization in the
age of information technology.

144
7.1.1 Database Management System (DBMS)
Databases are usually developed, maintained and controlled by
the Database Management System (DBMS). The DBMS essentially serves
as an interface between databases and end users or application programs,
ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains easily
accessible.
Here are some examples of popular DBMSs used these days:
MySql
•
Oracle
.
.
Microsoft SQL Server
MongoDB
•
Visual Foxpro
• IBM Db2
Sun M
Microsoft
Visual FoxPro ORACLE
DB2
SimpleDB
MySQL, PostgreSQL

• PostgreSQL
7.1.2 Flat File System
Fig: 7.1 Popular DBMS
Early databases were relatively "flat", which means they were limited to
simple rows and columns, like a spreadsheet. A flat file is the older version
of database. It stores data in a single table structure. Flat file databases
are usually in plain text format, with only one record per line. The fields
included in the record are separated using delimiters such as tabs or
commas.
7.1.3 Advantages of Database Management System over the Flat File
System:
DBMS
Multiple users can access data
simultaneously
Flat File System
Only one user can access at a time
Capable of handling huge sets of Suitable only for smaller sets of
data
Allows non-duplication and
integrity
Supports online access
data
Increases duplicate and redundant
data
Does not support remote
connections
Good for small, medium and large Limited only to smaller data
businesses
management needs

145
Characteristics of Database Management System
A DBMS is modern version of database designing, organization and
manipulation. This mainly offers the solutions which a flat file system
could not provide. The DBMS has many characteristics. Some of them are:
•
•
.
Multiple users can access DBMS and can view, add, edit and delete
records.
A DBMS offers tools like Queries, Views and Forms which help users
to manipulate data easily and more efficiently.
A DBMS is more secure and reliable.
DBMS allows distribution of data in multiple tables by making use
of features like keys and relationships between fields of those tables.
This allows lesser duplication of data and results in lesser
redundancy.
Preparing backups and providing limited permissions to the users
are features of DBMS.
DBMS can handle large and complex data more conveniently.
Therefore, it is preferred by the medium and large organizations.

(i)
Define basic database terms like table, field, record,
data type, etc.
BASIC COMPONENTS OF DBMS
The basic components of DBMS are discussed below:
Table
It is a collection of data elements organized in shape of rows and
columns. A contact list may be one of the simplest examples of a table. The
marks record prepared by a class teacher is also an example of a table.
(ii) Field
It is the smallest component in a
database. It is where the actual data is
stored during data entry. All data
fields in the same table, have unique
names. Fields are also called
attributes or columns. Multiple fields
make up a data record, several data

Fig: 7.2 Components of a Table
records make up a data table, and several data tables make up a database.

146
(iii) Record
A single entry in a table is called a record. Records are also referred
as tuples or rows. A record is made up of two or several data items which
are also called tuples in a table representing a set of related data. For
example, the illustrated Student table (Fig: 7.2) has 4 tuples
/records/rows.
(iv) Data Types
All fields in a table must have some data type. Data type is a data
storage format that can contain a specific type or range of values. The data
type of a field is a property that tells what kind of data that field can hold.
Here are some basic data types.
Data Type
Integer
Description
Examples
Holds only whole numbers.
145, -35, 74586
Floating Point
Holds numbers with decimal
points.
5.6, 3.14, 554.9
Character
String
Boolean
Date & Time
Stores only one character.
Can store a combination of
numbers, letters and special
characters.
Can hold only Boolean values i.e.
true or false.
Stores date and time in specified
format.

Different DBMSs offer different range of data types to be stored. For
example, MS Access allows a range of whole numbers from -32768 to
32767 for an "Integer". In modern DBMS, choosing proper data type is
important to make sure that database runs faster.
Teacher
Note
Teachers are advised to explain the concepts of data
types and components of DBMS by demonstrating MS
Access Components.

147
(v)
Views
In a database the data is stored in tables. However, we can see that
data through views. Views do not store data and just show the information
virtually. They have the ability to fetch data from different tables. Views
maintain the security of data and ensure that no changes occur in the
original data.
(i)
Now we will learn how can we create Tables and Views in MS Access.
Steps for creating a table using Design View:
1. To create tables in Access using “Design View," click on the Create
tab and click on the Table icon. Then pull down the View menu and
choose Design View.

2. A new table then appears in the Table Design View. Note that the
default name assigned to the table is Table 1.
3. Type the name of a field into the "Field Name" column.
4. Then use the drop-down menu in the “Data Type” column to assign
the field a data type.

148
5. If desired, type a description of the data stored in this field.

Steps for creating a query or view using Design View:
1. To make a query in design view, click on the “Create” tab in the
Ribbon and pull down the "Queries” group and click on “Query
Design" button.
2. In the "Show Table" dialog box, add the table or tables that you want
to add to query design view.
3. Next, add the fields from these tables that you want to view in your
query results or view. If you want to add all of the fields of a table
into your result set, you can click and drag the first field in the table,
shown as an asterisk.
4. Once you have added all the necessary tables and fields to the query
or view, click the “Close” button in the "Show Table” dialog box to
close it and display the query design view.
5. To run a query and view the result set, you can click the “Run”
button in the “Results” group of the “Design” tab in the "Query
Tools" contextual tab on the office Ribbon.
6. The result set looks like a table. This result set is a reflection of data
from the selected fields of the tables. It is also known as a view.
7. Click the “Save” button in the Quick Access toolbar. Type a name for
your view and click “OK” to save the query.

Define entity
Discuss about the term relationship, in the context
of database
Distinguish among primary, foreign and referential
keys
7.3 Data Modeling
Data modeling is a process of developing conceptual representation
of data objects and their relations. Data models are used to express how
the information will be stored in database. This helps to identify the most
important fields and remove the irrelevant data. Data models can be used
by database developers to create a physical database. This saves a lot of
time and efforts of developers. There are three most important
components of data models.
(i)
Entity
(ii)
Relationship
(iii)
Referential Keys

151
7.3.1 Entity
In literal sense, an entity is any individual object which has its own
qualities and properties. In database terms, an entity is an independent
table and its fields are known as attributes. As an example, a Payroll
database will contain an entity named Employees. The Employees entity
will contain various attributes like EmployeeID, Name, Designation,
Salary, etc.
7.3.2 Relationship
When the database structures grew and became more complex, a
lot of data started to become redundant which means that data was being
unnecessarily duplicated. This created a need to connect data entities
instead of repeating same data in multiple tables. This resulted in the
creation of relationships and Relational Database Management Systems
(RDBMS).
A relationship defines the connection between two tables. It creates
a connection from an attribute of one entity with an attribute of another
entity. Three types of relationships can be defined between entities.
(i) One to One Relationship
This type of relationship defines that a record in one entity can be
connected to only one record in another entity. This is not a very common
type of relationship because the data from related entities can directly be
placed in a single entity. However, this type of relationship is used to
divide larger entities into smaller ones.
(ii) One to Many Relationship
This type of relationship defines that a record in one entity can be
connected to many records in another entity. This is the most common
type of relationship used in relational databases. This relationship can
also be seen as Many to One Relationship.
(iii) Many to Many Relationship
In this type of relationship, one or more records of one entity are
connected to one or more records of another entity. Usually, a third entity
known as “junction table” is used to create the many-to-many
relationship between two related entities.

152
7.3.3 Referential Keys
The relationships are configured by using referential keys on
entities. The keys determine a certain set of rules that must be followed by
the data stored in a field of an entity. In larger databases, keys are very
important to uniquely identify a specific record. Two types of keys are
most commonly used in RDBMSs:
(i)
Primary Key
A primary key is used to uniquely identify a record in an entity.
When a primary key is applied to any attribute in an entity, it forces the
rules of Primary Key onto that attribute. These rules are:
.
•
(ii)
The attribute (field) must contain a unique value to identify a record. A
unique value means that two records in the same entity cannot have
the same value stored in this attribute where Primary Key is applied.
The value of the attribute where Primary Key is applied, cannot be null.
Foreign Key
A foreign key is used to define the connection or relation between
two entities. The foreign key of one entity is configured to be connected to
the primary key of another entity. When a foreign key is applied on an
attribute, it enforces that the value for that attribute should match any
record in the related entity having a primary key.
Understanding relationship and referential keys:
The figure 7.3 shows four tables and their fields.
Students table is used to store personal information of individual
student. It has an Id field set as a Primary Key. It also has a ClassId field to
setup a One-to-One foreign key relationship with the Class table.
Class table is used to store information about classrooms in a school. It has
an Id field set as a Primary Key. A student can be enrolled in only one class;
hence, Students table has a One-to-One relationship with Class table.
However, many teachers can be associated with many classes. This
requires a Many-to-Many relationship between Class and Teachers tables.

Fig: 7.3 Entity Relationship Diagram
Teachers table is used to store personal information about a teacher. It
has an Id field set as a Primary Key. Many classes can be taught by many
teachers. This requires a Many-to-Many relationship between Teachers
and Class tables.
TeachersClass table is used as a junction table to facilitate the Many-to-
Many relationship between Teacher and Class tables. It also contains an
Id field set as Primary Key. The other two fields are used to define which
teachers are associated with which classes. It creates a One-to-Many
relationship with each of the two connected tables. Teachers and Class
tables use their TeachersClassId field's foreign key relationship to fetch
the related information from this table.

Define term ER model
Design ER model for a database in M.S Access
7.3.4 Entity Relationship or ER Model
Entity Relationship Model (ERM) or Entity Relationship Diagram
(ERD) describes the entities, attributes and relationships with their types
in a simplified diagram. This model or diagram can itself be used as the
reference for designing an actual database. It can even be used as a
backup for the structure of a database. The ERD can be used in two ways:

154
(i)
•
When the database has not been created yet. The ERD helps in
creating a clear representation of the entire database based on user
requirements.
When an existing database needs to be documented. The Database
development tool features automatic creation of ERD based on
existing database which facilitates documentation.
Components of ER Diagram
ER Design is made up of different components like Attributes,
Relationships, etc. There are defined symbols and shapes to represent
each one of them. Some of the shapes used to define these
components are:
1
1
1
A rectangle is used to define an entity. This
can be any real-world object like Student,
Teacher, Class, etc.
An ellipse defines an attribute of an entity.
One entity may contain multiple attributes
and are defined by multiple ellipses.
Relationships are symbolically represented
by diamond shape. It simply states the type
of relationship between two entities.
M
Connecting lines show the type of relationship
between two entities. These lines are
annotated by 1 or M (stands for Many) at
their ends to describe the type of relationship.

155
(ii)
Steps to design ER Model
1. Identify and design the entities based on the requirements of its
users.
2. Identify and design the attributes within the required entities.
3. Identify the relationships required between entities.
4. Define Primary Keys in interrelated entities.
5. Design Foreign Key relationships based on requirements and bind
them to previously created Primary Keys.
6. Generate an automated Entity Relationship Diagram
For example a sample ERD for the statement “A writer creates a novel and
consumer buys novel" is discussed below.
Here in this example, diagram shows that:
•
Entities are in rectangular Box
1. Writer
2. Consumer
3. Novel
Relationships are in Diamond Shape
1. Create
2. Buys
Writer
Creates
Consumer
Novel
Buys
Teacher
Note
Teachers are expected to help students in designing
an ER Model as given in the Activity section.

SUMMARY
.
A database stores data in an organized form.
Databases are used in many different organizations and various
industries.
A Database Management System (DBMS) software allows convenient
creation, modification and display of data in a database.
There are many popular DBMS programs such as Microsoft SQL,
MySQL, Oracle, etc.
The data in a flat file database is limited to rows and columns in a table.
Flat file databases usually store data as plain text.
A DBMS can handle huge sets of data and has multi-user support.
The fields in a table can be defined as one of the supported data types
which best suits the type of data it holds.
A Relational DBMS introduces concepts of entities, attributes,
relationships and keys.
A table is also called an entity, a record is also called row or tuple and a
field is also called an attribute or column.
♦ There are essentially two types of relationships: One-to-One
relationship and One-to-Many relationship.
One-to-One relationship relates a record from one entity to only one
record of another entity.
One-to-Many relationship relates a record from one entity to one or
more records of another entity.
♦ Many-to-Many relationship is a combination of two One-to-Many
relationships with the help of a junction table.
• Relationships make use of Keys.
Two common types of keys are Primary Keys and Foreign Keys.
♦ Primary key uniquely identifies records in an entity.
Foreign key defines a relationship between two entities.
Entity Relationship Model (ERM) or Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
graphically displays the structure of a database.
The components of ERD include Entities, Attributes and
Relationships.
ERDs are used to either design a new database or document an existing
one.
