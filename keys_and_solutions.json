        "solution": " The torque produced by a couple is given by the formula: Torque = Force x Distance. Since the mechanic applies a force of 15N at each end of the spanner, the total force applied is 15N + 15N = 30N. However, for a couple, the forces are equal and opposite, so we consider the force applied at one end. Given that the torque produced is 60Nm, we can use the formula: 60 Nm = 15N x Distance. To find the length of the moment arm of the couple, we can rearrange the formula to solve for Distance: Distance = Torque / Force = 60 Nm / 15 N = 4 Nm / N = 4 m. However, the distance here is the total length of the couple, which is twice the length of the moment arm. So, the length of the moment arm of the couple is 4 m / 2 = 2 m."
