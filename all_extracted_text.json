But know that the best thing you can do for them is get well. And that means focus on yourself. They'll feel better when you feel better, as I did when my wife was finally breast cancer free. Each day, I'll be pulling for you and cheering you on.\n* In heart, Grant M.\n\nThese words and phrases are written in cursive handwriting, with varying line lengths and spacing throughout the letter.
